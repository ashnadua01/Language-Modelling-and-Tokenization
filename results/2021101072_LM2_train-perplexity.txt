mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire.	22.39263913205457
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	17.37702801612789
after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	31.009050871280884
but he is a liberal master, i suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."	30.224429310685053
elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.	65.3111671659643
"all young ladies accomplished!	111.24639662631057
what has she to do with it?	120.77981715534156
she was teazed by mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.	20.07713082250297
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	12.067635702601505
i am the happiest creature in the world.	49.09165718768142
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her."	32.460453705022616
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of that, i can assure you, he informed me himself."	16.403600729184532
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	15.048630544054555
i would go and see her, if i could have the carriage."	49.13063760712548
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.	27.49807565061832
"yes, sir; but i do not know when that will be.	39.94445948359651
they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	29.31446213604296
so imprudent a match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	22.6277770122175
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	19.758184625123192
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."	30.924476742156557
"there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	40.9763665077624
many small donations ($ 1 to $ 5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs.	12.765449600251248
i had not an idea of it."	74.84195618239524
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	17.623518011911614
i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not, but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	18.884122656679335
she was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	18.32123905248214
but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for?	59.68583226152409
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	13.781944693259776
mr bingley arrived.	253.81207560572102
"your first position is false.	63.29913393294149
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	23.601515575656276
but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	13.994072001951901
"are you not diverted?"	81.71223371249961
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	21.551240082421597
"let us sit down.	113.68385591644302
after sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth, "i hope you are well, miss bennet.	28.06102059597215
is not it so, mrs bennet?"	78.78692361606439
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its being created."	37.14115099337645
make haste, make haste.	113.31184998301205
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.	29.450246424256033
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	17.967956303408105
every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	43.05614925905239
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets.	93.63242388227056
"of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	34.8901211657465
let me mend it for you.	90.95187547824727
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet.--they had several children.	23.252850125389447
with them he is remarkably agreeable."	75.5567717738183
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.	18.965562087464324
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park.	35.569629756199944
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	28.396709584097866
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	23.845285503104208
they may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."	13.534910040321844
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	36.28381573672474
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	17.256526043486556
i have a high respect for your nerves.	60.21006777523435
bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	33.23731770137126
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	48.5002828558927
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	24.61194620909673
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed."	24.534839204423513
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	13.496574974656436
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	23.670643974293647
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."	21.727173896104674
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	22.302447335464148
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	24.530287562598094
have you never happened to see her there?"	55.426108298857294
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do, when i tell you all."	31.913938082396307
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	39.77469291348647
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	48.21628742324203
the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.	19.5496314052083
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	40.836660793911186
mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure."	41.185374436014584
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."	15.313297592812152
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	16.901460531481614
it is mr bingley i am sure.	84.90087471721937
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	17.097585766297986
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more."	36.15362222231989
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	17.11047966585198
we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	16.464636918843127
he heard her with astonishment.	132.08539774576965
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	57.76304663832783
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	15.258311786500125
"but upon my honour i do not.	60.494603505850144
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."	18.113200177384783
nonsense, how can you talk so!	82.08390755780971
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	19.173115561589814
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."	32.753871639038444
i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced."	37.15399069867274
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had."	54.251323443747786
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	48.41738623385245
"i am sure i shall break mine," said lydia.	36.22169096466917
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to."	30.300535890493638
you are so strange!	150.52459020632966
oh!	714.3130208232782
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother lady catherine.	17.81866154736664
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	28.388819280885173
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.	19.483691582127555
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	34.917053795075745
neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."	17.79313827727899
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	21.59226703221743
"but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	23.075582549866045
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	51.1663170436094
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight.	39.46353956521746
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	39.95274727807603
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	15.235245924597939
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in london.	21.192005978578806
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."	28.4806484819662
you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."	23.383592359911532
"which do you mean?"	73.32103563019263
he was well, but so much engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	37.825543609041176
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did.	34.698708788159784
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	20.088317024943134
"not that i shall though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."	17.212493094200877
she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	17.832597222197343
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	50.01583760200703
no, no, this is not likely.	92.50435974067689
said mrs bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	30.54418772126153
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	15.208367532404088
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals."	12.75079245889299
when mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	21.765183389043013
is this to be endured!	182.6190533741095
cried his wife impatiently.	163.17020088395728
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	13.48350057563692
never mind miss lizzy's hair."	64.095398718651
she directly replied, "you need not be frightened.	66.49798678194507
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.	17.06953969101167
"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	33.10386863749635
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	15.820112238766091
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	42.23024186587649
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	22.23037216798484
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."--it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	16.13261755791644
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	15.376473848594584
it was very little less.	129.08589046584225
miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	19.509493883495153
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	24.902132472913067
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	24.21637564869278
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	18.607893066210398
"oh!	271.02234991487614
but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	26.30162751338691
but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself."	17.429337120503714
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	16.366298407265774
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	52.36744878921915
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.	31.524050718930795
i always said it must be so, at last.	59.956689304826845
remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."	19.954072236682105
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	18.13439118915533
mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	31.59901455648345
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	12.166462977934902
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	46.664423093919666
"well, and what news does it bring?	63.96173054349728
if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	26.992186024072904
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	32.491900608577225
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart.	19.534128938999583
you may have drawn him in."	74.26931779120507
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?	34.748413543396005
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	39.208413707532564
mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	11.91882473152032
both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	44.0745082642712
sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	27.062866763799025
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr darcy they had only seen at church.	27.21645615005551
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley.	33.56474975824276
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	10.84554832429755
he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."	25.611957135070437
1.d.	251.69028548379788
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	48.442825738463945
and so, darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!	19.827104510390072
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret.	36.73903592713823
during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	32.46946668480637
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	31.95219027419457
"i am glad i bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	21.2389382230675
the second began.	255.56350089841956
mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	15.940201634795237
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted.	58.57319146154534
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	65.0308227284511
when this was done, she had a less active part to play.	46.75839698537833
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	33.87963819260649
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	32.92921492060688
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london, mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	15.738291208032233
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	39.72607818967351
i am so pleased--so happy.	63.431586288161
"oh!	271.02234991487614
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.	10.154673253842548
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	23.396558975569064
the supposition did not pain her.	106.58860682219664
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	55.328373124995
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	19.443783701254223
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.	32.667189044665186
as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	28.931403710637678
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	21.004650724709148
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet.	17.906326477752746
follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without."	16.061375383306935
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.	14.955439889184804
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	22.193342744515643
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	48.43927922185713
she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	17.664793390777493
chapter viii.	412.12655134874456
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen.	20.082294045862447
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	17.881778813069253
"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	13.109834768735425
you are safe from me."	81.76520053391783
he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	47.311703322930434
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	25.75651745900479
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	31.21207235881469
on distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.	28.890701033094924
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	27.778858286131996
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	18.82503877770672
mrs bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	28.97062229206994
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	26.338503377953344
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.	14.927315587560091
chapter xi.	412.12655134874456
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	45.0376609297078
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	27.822002960475977
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.	30.663142143704945
our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character.	19.1021800025785
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	151.02725087326814
"and i have another favour to ask.	61.422515612005434
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	31.93943360561903
"it must not be thought of.	106.04845932570984
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	19.63777335320085
and gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth called out, "dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	17.541307369361355
mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.	16.291830883832016
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	12.832523071269094
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	26.76856731565336
said elizabeth.	370.63871968949104
cried mrs gardiner.	294.6366980373363
"indeed i do not dare."	76.56051931526515
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	11.505643975965219
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	26.351836125354037
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her.	55.565196697505925
i believe i have now told you every thing.	60.615353695442714
he now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as well as of mr darcy.	13.197288811057687
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.	35.081175435126376
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "this walk is not wide enough for our party.	23.707282967962104
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	28.37341149860005
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	82.1899124215675
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	53.16747412777054
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	101.78280751638681
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	40.62791468171443
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."	37.42564570065478
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	21.271182184963035
"what is it you mean?"	66.52668345261824
there could not exist in the world two men, over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence.	27.19427970671934
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	21.26333100099059
the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth's intimate friend.	28.24730869733433
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	33.4015625194761
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james's.	13.713760324118377
he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	28.465550683538446
i rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	27.662775769035868
"it did.	306.61719854552166
"i beg your pardon.	87.14568314569156
"oh!	271.02234991487614
[illustration: dove-dale] pride & prejudice.	36.30332247914274
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	56.534283504290094
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	36.94386538553011
the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	14.211939113049269
oh!	714.3130208232782
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	27.622830293274735
mr darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	45.535270846936136
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	45.80043439887309
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."	24.945976047825937
she has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	25.466088794773913
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way.	15.859081940907402
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	38.81906886439744
"these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature.	24.252065073850797
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."	18.614915962594907
can it be really so!	121.88369721197978
the officers will find women better worth their notice.	38.91975745642969
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	79.53583199848498
how he lived i know not.	96.7351294167812
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	27.05620267310102
its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	38.22366194902377
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	15.087360394440864
lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.	16.522891130297182
i do not deserve it.	99.55961701617444
cried he.	545.6768289374838
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	32.43385767565733
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	20.507588034134855
vol.	1205.3165081967588
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.	28.632467781408824
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	66.03558046186629
lady catherine seemed resigned.	132.4752209813548
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	32.53107984577025
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	24.730975764148027
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	52.78492272650369
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	19.26802830431289
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	27.07820273362831
i don't know.	100.70101096710162
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	14.223371855793209
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.	20.63530385741304
as yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	38.955371311043145
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her.	18.30907692437803
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	20.061322873426747
what does he say?	166.3199107281426
wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	29.698222046510107
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	32.946604030306595
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	29.31485521925409
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."	32.26576815898913
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!	49.166277655717074
i know how much you dislike him."	58.558982974823486
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	24.674512958426046
mr bennet replied that he had not.	87.46764888809697
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	14.888788270207373
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	16.272743567812686
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	32.40178229041822
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	27.956126168299765
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	37.93450859173946
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	49.927075945250984
"i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail.	42.738843533574475
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!	17.602870146939072
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!	31.446626466738568
his attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	52.50488340158726
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	22.95411065447729
chapter xiv.	440.93963481431535
we passed each other several times.	96.8447824311577
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should be deceived again.	20.711706141910334
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	31.389968788095377
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	64.00496517365872
it will save me a world of trouble and economy.	36.72841176983445
"yes, all of them, i think.	74.01911959220183
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	20.654530881361897
i ought not to have said a word about it.	57.22691797947202
chapter xii.	412.12655134874456
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	17.219819856830167
and it was not wholly without foundation.	69.5672685170611
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley.	16.622288140912527
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	10.284620902606115
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	14.927777457751846
every body said how well she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	29.057077597027547
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	29.142336473751076
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."	18.526110994761517
i am so happy.	150.51992136567907
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.	12.382356915154668
it is evident that you belong to the first circles.	63.966595083074154
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	16.550439047991844
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	15.598205022116131
then shewing her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	28.854436645147988
"you know nothing of the matter.	95.18361934336437
and to see dear wickham too!	107.34402575790122
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged.	22.27248638723899
he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	29.421469575426453
chapter v.	440.93963481431535
"lizzy, you must not do so.	76.77681510837849
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	51.00265163559336
yet now i must believe you," cried jane.	63.01990767595739
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	25.07985912030369
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	30.19232650808986
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	31.093327494511314
but enough of this.	237.63359542242344
"you are over scrupulous surely.	68.73750799486699
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	18.545188818560128
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	15.908677428485749
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	19.93517201954479
she cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving wickham.	29.72318574894018
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	22.51710632210161
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	26.230137234504916
adieu.	1574.1826158876936
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy, were to entertain each other.	41.293959212626945
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	19.026866105167027
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!	21.983075469566774
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	28.590941090834956
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	15.269910310828807
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.	17.559395110774805
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	20.620487921304143
1.c.	243.03088566733908
as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	16.669865417560608
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	40.54357659444617
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.	14.638453763514569
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.	35.45620489504421
and there was my aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	24.74590518028923
but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	18.976166869034103
"with my mother up stairs.	89.58166321280088
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	17.010269776716967
not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	17.980289966255118
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	18.409248582604274
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	15.841723306504795
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.	16.922556418884213
mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	53.42999509391934
i am not equal to it.	88.43954097343706
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	14.415238639866896
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	92.02647262719864
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged.	27.35644542469669
we had better go into the avenue."	58.66076558515843
"how strange this is!	137.590673706948
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	17.046113859731978
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he feared w.	21.191250693960235
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	14.411559546836868
of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	23.287101678048515
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy.	18.118039178815607
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"	38.456526214030774
oh!	714.3130208232782
his appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	27.509228054232914
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."	28.319386553026675
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!	48.21489106010905
"my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	29.105826061641604
her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.	15.907857884290003
unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only child) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.	12.27701431752158
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"	21.37171310004718
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	105.74732515069353
i have not that pain.	120.31159489202952
1.e.6.	64.45994739749796
"it keeps him in good humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	23.368470765951464
i speak nothing but the truth.	122.74757966706186
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of affection to myself."	14.8832167688116
he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	42.281012562103406
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	19.673646268932952
perhaps he thought her too young.	109.91481870087873
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	24.607380953851692
oh!	714.3130208232782
"that is as it happens.	106.68457198617857
oh, lizzy!	298.58132153652076
the others have been gone on to scarborough, these three weeks."	33.35471215442614
we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."	17.226412146850723
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.	41.34385529855308
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	9.940073709825642
"what could he mean?	145.86835651227247
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."	16.374860458585157
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	28.059587669322344
"i never heard that it was."	66.37606226870575
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious.	17.20185417239923
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	20.594953990523454
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.	14.640167795187114
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	30.99043853335718
"mrs annesley is with her.	79.81002043215521
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	48.23083003062657
"and that i suppose is one of your sisters."	58.00864162558805
he had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	15.508500637408101
it was to be such a secret!"	77.25589475880564
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	27.730796775787482
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money."	33.376943533105845
i need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	16.516842401622934
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy.	53.3739857209112
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	21.746263661335725
thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	25.99136014496229
it was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	15.769435159424802
he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	55.83092497308168
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford."	25.492684489066672
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.	17.73384165167598
here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.	10.987845772648864
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.	41.2391542566006
"it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	22.93796553093551
upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	47.79011194253665
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed.	23.792707247106968
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	34.86090726463931
and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.	14.806392052295342
"very much."	176.303450895937
"not yet," replied jane.	95.90004984564425
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	38.11125027877967
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	36.6016503955712
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	16.560662916456078
the tête-à-tête surprised them.	144.57998129741887
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	24.559667247415575
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	24.812836477508956
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with.	15.971659499571949
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	16.553367826151636
they have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	38.74102669399744
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	58.75227131980066
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	32.314250717199336
but however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.	39.831781903594326
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	24.30657432869144
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	27.308199212518808
you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done for the young people.	44.512064538031005
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	19.204126432613528
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	35.497188072370896
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."	11.388803469351432
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit.	18.08706004356768
my father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property.	20.46815173303517
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	33.35871789744241
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	48.83573797987733
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	13.52894928596808
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.	32.31596243666464
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	21.95391183114142
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	14.198268543082996
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	29.63957815770136
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	22.179226867727433
but think no more of the letter.	103.07228461776621
i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	23.80257330129431
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family!	31.089564846329882
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	30.08515114650251
"yes--that is what makes it amusing.	43.695300681040486
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	28.520961803505944
the moral will be perfectly fair.	104.84854274283656
in every view it is unaccountable!"	76.32366755759729
that lady i suppose is your mother."	73.3064857856988
"no, no.	161.32444630368641
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	25.315429510062117
"my dear, dear lydia!"	57.93445899542627
their reception at home was most kind.	92.39505179092572
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	30.994436517347282
it became her turn to listen.	95.3170987191039
she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	14.565091807072692
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him.	13.619296483269252
charlotte did not stay much longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	34.67261609517171
at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	18.702873350232956
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	39.29377679109259
but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	20.90787489040037
said jane.--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her."	40.48148646597474
it cannot last long.	150.9947589738957
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to think."	25.145288392660618
"you mistake me, my dear.	81.5238462323432
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	70.62684146498107
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."	14.549659518059538
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	17.273051195480726
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	17.695285422508295
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	21.590231528247784
nobody can tell what i suffer!--but it is always so.	43.999828277647936
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now, mr darcy.--i talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."	15.964816465683676
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her-- "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"	15.033332779673934
"so much the better.	110.01406963640063
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	53.78679669296351
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	21.163495152550496
the dejection was almost universal.	110.68296419715016
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	20.045314793629107
she has two nieces of her own.	81.60341016792519
"no--why should he?	88.0808042418501
on that head, therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	15.307782593629101
well, colonel fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	45.88326707318346
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy."	20.381878399126904
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	37.918084870042776
it was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	10.584052232734825
"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."	27.784389060160333
sir william did not say much.	106.79084935293503
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	55.364410465451165
"and is this all?"	84.59715301788111
could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	61.280826555017924
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months.	13.9055898343352
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	19.441876950770162
my father bears it better.	96.27688520389952
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	52.322439482878416
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london.	18.123488856184057
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."	21.848659967387484
"i should imagine not."	79.87723207366427
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy."	30.22354237261535
a young man, such as you describe mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	16.961045642365036
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.	32.4923851391314
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."	17.298527985319314
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	42.8557158862709
you thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	54.0323371817685
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire.	20.660027393539227
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	39.51375082118779
"care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	21.478981632461362
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	21.170709528294285
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	75.54422979918023
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	50.12264300583446
and his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	35.584055663518406
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	37.74865514435383
when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	19.253378655527463
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	22.192922678444056
my temper i dare not vouch for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	20.585544678913823
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	41.1084687736486
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	12.942967770836805
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	16.640193760737933
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was."	49.63914345438684
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "oh!	29.9376569687604
my dear jane, mr collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	17.08946563535979
i write rather slowly."	91.7168537505389
again she read on.	177.84781572214524
the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	18.968501398803966
she knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	40.44187582913961
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	47.99401905552499
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	15.048517138531347
"so much the better.	110.01406963640063
said miss bingley; "will she be as tall as i am?"	37.39074698966596
they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	27.518425562786675
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	81.09016190448148
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	57.92106748695076
"her not objecting, does not justify him.	41.11258572565936
&c."	182.07222273530826
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	16.65347324277487
cried bingley.	526.9395906402002
he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	32.56436458916848
seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.	28.102323675263378
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	18.487239803927178
i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	30.01569646423616
"oh!	271.02234991487614
but you know married women have never much time for writing.	39.3807973528986
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	25.753634184363126
"is it possible!"	120.130428070077
you do not know what i suffer."	61.62433856119985
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	29.369855742394897
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.	14.87527193753242
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	24.02907631061618
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	16.4477095638882
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	70.81275258097665
her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	16.53797442987477
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.	26.61888897692562
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	21.703907145464164
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"	21.682115642468112
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	39.55127565275119
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him."	19.63452254557755
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	16.785558933514206
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	28.944866577722916
she could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	15.284227242952213
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, "in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	15.852306309316205
"your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet."	67.1980072908271
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	32.40773915722125
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	16.330562703019982
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	32.17192246789534
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	56.92227910053424
she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	32.49087010999338
"good heavens!"	131.9590608475835
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.	25.59692816556319
my affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."	21.71717026355273
i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's regard."	24.140823192126714
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	15.507936552108768
i could hardly keep my countenance.	82.03334092170682
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	38.63768885823935
you must and shall be married by a special licence.	49.47256898756467
"my dear, you flatter me.	70.39879034909276
elizabeth was forced to go.	118.4270850210863
well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	30.764384498727125
and then we were so merry all the way home!	55.842492217879766
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	20.21262802298409
chapter x.	412.12655134874456
and for this we are to be thankful.	86.8103816779801
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	19.975068355991358
but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	15.428865185144206
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	30.747740987484846
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.	30.415532053089297
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	31.457454059013774
what is the matter?"	133.01149076181477
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	18.647607885644895
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself."	22.60096965088837
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."	36.51015198866363
our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great.	70.51132768565705
"but you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."	20.694210814500256
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."	20.245285519507878
but it ended in nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	26.31675786777258
if there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	25.923399322746864
at such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	48.572896386468756
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	23.38696782541364
she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	42.229312892703504
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better.	15.56453350122541
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.	19.26791596693747
"when i consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that i might have prevented it!--i who knew what he was.	23.970637793820313
"i will make no promise of the kind."	60.4479343208233
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."	12.919804746598007
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	52.39319495578054
but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	45.763729887167045
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	18.99304249449865
"i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife.	38.202917082591206
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.	16.84230224809552
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.	15.84402411889841
chapter vi.	440.93963481431535
he knows where we live.	122.25514989480493
"colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	21.640328078099177
but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."	26.192109738533564
* * * * * transcriber's note: spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book.	13.539427737471767
she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	31.58556938096681
poor little lizzy!	292.11177516908367
it was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	32.34839139551274
let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	34.12000229499942
lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball."	28.972948131254494
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	46.617154830445045
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	14.617006218714394
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	19.019275400077962
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	53.89204858808557
who are your uncles and aunts?	62.85559601468622
"my dear niece, "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you.	17.325713202658644
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.	9.767288616573152
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	17.951968906096468
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	16.834701580074995
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	20.638239100563418
has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	35.34398118847159
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."	18.785466243000645
"i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news.	38.794324799145244
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	31.17655696781269
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	28.230621003113555
she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, "come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	19.614123679077267
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."	22.306691452521903
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.	26.38040188988868
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	35.06636973252186
if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him.	40.93458745873977
they have some of the finest woods in the country."	50.01711196232454
the lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	49.50760598805907
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	17.398692552635893
"yes, very handsome."	85.90850453575662
did she call to refuse her consent?"	43.60371076381239
till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him."	32.20790985661686
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	22.34394841024674
this he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	27.36361730542659
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.	24.794917856874665
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	14.268642387073902
are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"	47.201784555934665
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity."	30.798198697500766
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	20.425061801642173
chapter vii.	412.12655134874456
it is too long ago.	120.07662973915804
they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.	17.797696065951737
"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	44.230112965789814
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	44.95046377895146
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.	34.19515162919806
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	14.641604695103618
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	29.912721986064234
and so extremely accomplished for her age!	81.3093422628271
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner.	49.24307932618319
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	20.719107254281244
there is nothing he would not do for her."	62.48148493294124
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	26.194758385496527
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"	28.308473403868245
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	94.53227371632941
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	25.849394305023516
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	20.471047924610826
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	23.083357294751465
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	15.927799027356297
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	16.558133102814804
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	79.10356690289782
such very superior dancing is not often seen.	74.58234847693726
i am not romantic you know.	70.45857334919106
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.	15.195092002319358
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	23.704428338923247
there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.	20.355749743641255
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.	20.673694812560072
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.	28.967781215320368
elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	17.10579669972183
but it is all, all too late now."	53.16446189928417
"but you will know it, when i have told you what happened the very next day."	33.29541341276467
i know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	23.875555048453506
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	17.626628704675905
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	28.363544116103377
this will never do."	136.14817914827472
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?	20.030657660218047
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	22.965317135903298
end of the second volume.	154.91420288289552
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	20.518759879707016
you take delight in vexing me.	72.64431133528299
mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	16.72152066927522
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	31.145183470461305
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	20.95559098699003
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.	40.57431518714578
you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	38.9579893863576
but georgiana would not join her.	102.97501781460647
bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.	18.250290828707058
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	16.86332581428671
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	18.692275122392825
"you are mistaken.	146.1911110357205
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	15.313704969250882
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	31.603889232154803
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	27.411829439129306
for, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	16.501672634102214
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me."	22.63377282163148
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	39.84288807452918
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	15.320023795224955
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?"	15.110205639052639
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	93.91579353884535
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	39.37356094941932
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	16.67990913243804
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i particularly begged him to do.	20.545193896266706
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	22.264402728615682
"you are severe on us."	64.05468879092156
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	25.092122739377036
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	16.17192397656688
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	20.525285496783813
but do not imagine that he is always here so often.	58.2782787993893
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew.	62.73269884763422
and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	37.438008866095714
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	23.34809151831496
your's, &c."	51.90658948622516
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention.	22.10694050205243
well, much good may it do them!	57.08539640169793
those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	27.60436123710551
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."	15.11129295719644
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	20.8453386670094
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	14.59958674998941
i knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	15.590232140563966
your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."	27.09642825642697
till i was in kent, and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself.	32.26513389471153
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."	17.222398622386358
"if one could but go to brighton!"	46.309311816623584
"is that his design in settling here?"	51.39585710634712
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.	26.693982066638107
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	12.938355885516215
said she.	402.44987842688954
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	13.386651096978587
but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	25.563406088503562
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	18.34545469292438
they shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	14.411599348606533
mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	10.318794921502983
things are settled so oddly."	64.81056677646491
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	31.457946588637075
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just tolerable."	22.370988078687848
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	41.81639907637106
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	19.473405272425385
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	14.079734308612508
"yes, very well.	108.10801027321251
i am afraid you will be angry."	54.93287416713767
chapter xi.	412.12655134874456
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, "you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right.	14.294087988621602
"when my eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	33.751394914133186
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."	28.89531263485895
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.	10.779387417499814
jane now came up.	167.90159914006006
their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	16.761780793646352
he comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	31.872252245680947
he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	41.21923033694438
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	30.433985073024015
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham.	15.492760043608367
lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	38.127991270355295
and poor mr darcy!	194.60490043565002
this cannot be!	324.6995830452144
the party did not supply much conversation.	78.84155662083754
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	39.76638975957722
after abusing you so abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."	27.680553438563575
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."	21.41268003989734
i shall be back by dinner."	58.988435456811615
"and men take care that they should."	52.730473563140954
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."	25.176073081730625
this letter is from mr collins."	86.57557667482656
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.	16.41814536131875
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	36.491619984923396
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."	26.86879970387609
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."	22.801412723850564
it cannot be concealed from any one.	78.37968781169829
"an easy distance do you call it?	60.65003894966663
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	18.716913481283573
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham.	20.365110615556063
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of me.	62.718666651118625
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand."	19.560795699566537
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	14.090917920338963
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	27.568209252578832
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!	34.01970479279929
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	19.36006815674696
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	45.0623997483578
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	17.033365061973022
there can be no occasion for your going so soon.	49.412592552954344
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, "my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	15.029620107993393
if i could but see you as happy!	89.52239297901056
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	16.104454370882685
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	21.951934822362112
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	53.51377984911411
invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square.	15.568770892989306
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	25.717557399906063
she cried.	413.9657554020985
yes--i understand you perfectly."	59.65450425436423
mr bennet protested against any description of finery.	44.05300118079621
"and how impossible in others!"	61.246875432614104
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	48.46631963090742
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.	38.32032762905058
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.	14.811283029546669
five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	23.58460661138218
"neglect!	544.7361978778988
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	28.21771173892402
chapter xiv.	440.93963481431535
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	28.597382857648967
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter.	83.0976185377256
my father and mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him.	26.486512866482204
he was very fond of them."	76.18603113437914
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."	23.00652411903186
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."	21.401479330650417
and in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	16.217985737237605
i am impatient to see him."	66.31584910440462
"very well.	218.9616195510657
you have employed your time much better.	61.1261759287316
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	16.565682327125224
vol.	1205.3165081967588
"and then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	16.780405773239337
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself.	22.07641041547385
but of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	14.94182763562605
never, even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings.	13.158110205417346
in truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	18.774228499457468
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	31.78478949208544
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	17.351784259655872
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.	17.94125299000947
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	26.30621473819617
miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	29.589882651417714
a person may be proud without being vain.	69.94490946075233
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	37.89245630147241
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	20.418445996219127
we acted with the best intentions."	94.43862096863339
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties.	10.998111900287297
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst's gown----" here she was interrupted again.	21.01661814883013
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	36.62220463371936
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	18.14854191904188
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."	16.84286062985476
here comes hill.	258.96602600280386
for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	26.903463432710417
after an affectionate parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown.	18.33460818971395
and though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	34.35941971221647
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	20.441668983343902
he had never before supposed that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	22.653709979576277
letters of business too!	164.95564001361376
pray forgive me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from p.	22.585258314463044
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	33.089042850172056
its completion depended on others.	93.05040234747717
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	69.22681148522369
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	29.432496908117848
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	14.002449266401305
he is so excessively handsome!	120.40505191902028
"what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way?	41.21756181511567
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	13.78953617450866
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.	30.551593458102552
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	48.88409194504965
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children.	34.564804929981946
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.	45.08960144465935
while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	23.0250969846644
she is not such a simpleton.	130.4319315163469
"you have.	273.61565451676694
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	18.03084539591746
they found mr bennet still up.	110.92677575889404
every thing nourishes what is strong already.	64.63274268134714
"you are joking, lizzy.	79.63575828680011
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs bennet instantly answered, "oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	16.180581206590094
"but you--how are you?"	66.3351959595647
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by wickham.	22.393283981603354
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	13.170575771990837
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	30.727293099841212
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	19.066754288075625
they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	21.03730631867194
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	13.452079420119992
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	34.96415325485692
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.	17.815004179584836
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	59.53664441159254
at last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance.	21.482932988816994
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	21.660722053902674
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	17.63807402813498
not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley.	20.784866341780805
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	58.848813538058025
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	67.62702001227285
he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	23.93129608803626
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	19.72753630870034
it is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."	25.941035092465363
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy, "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	18.303036381845263
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	18.63288142980369
in society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	35.67476615761763
yours ever, "caroline bingley."	121.42790555339619
at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."	17.46850288770182
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia, assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn.	14.186636454671746
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	48.5436330139848
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	18.692572390346427
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road."	31.47843400794987
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	26.60140195800631
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	106.21498832160576
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."	17.1347152471243
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "in vain have i struggled.	25.26908953263465
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	53.2215697145956
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	19.49435822907093
no principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy.	33.25825507142154
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	24.84786084178832
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	20.741133548618354
the garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	23.03534374506183
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	14.056142643316898
and with no one to speak to, of what i felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	22.264703345612674
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	19.994160420925688
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.	24.56123895139787
"my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	17.036698685316328
two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	17.21401210501343
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	16.584092984689832
all were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	12.769329251261327
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	36.960226698713406
she is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will make her know it."	28.710866795073425
"true.	508.128958974563
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him."	45.77746743179253
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	34.95797636350129
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has not sixpence of his own.	17.866178070570253
they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	16.21685747619256
you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	29.830965794820383
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections.	28.8090821268408
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	45.274190082299185
i hate such false friends.	92.80779302481425
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	15.166775711325302
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	13.885797143142684
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	37.54640812397174
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	53.434143624233776
jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	41.42576907661565
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	42.94880422361009
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	24.337865617407516
it mortifies me.	236.42184459223114
there is nothing else to be done.	84.6834217635181
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	34.5183169210757
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you.	24.64790653127066
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.	33.580258340069676
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	15.697961316827076
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	24.581261360008874
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	52.359066879999794
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	34.61866237814387
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	15.409773989777921
yes, miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	24.172184123220504
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	26.091257964487884
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	58.50633281075984
i only hope they may have half my good luck.	44.22900930783468
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	19.24543904177666
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."	25.939945004854756
kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	21.610740462557615
"i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design," said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	17.444337260028355
but i dare not hope it.	100.18655533839124
but your family owe me nothing.	78.05028436915812
of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	21.64213921699015
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	33.332566517170186
to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	43.396618015909795
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	12.856916429573037
"i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family."	37.71057065605559
"yes, sir, i know i am.	70.69586163629216
could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected.	26.47457621327975
every thing being settled between them, mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	19.14750725044767
she practises very constantly."	87.20879025192784
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!	51.99003753659607
"my dear jane!"	106.64174401927455
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ("the foundation" or pglaf), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg-tm electronic works.	11.650919199447252
mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	35.97179024001187
that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!	26.954043539341345
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	50.36378616351957
at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	53.23134196018616
she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself.	16.91799752060202
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	16.513525097172813
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	13.963510695919569
mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library.	41.26396273806678
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	39.39478430089407
"write to me very often, my dear."	65.33033519431275
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	17.78420007382747
but your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	19.748108856099552
he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	43.92247172843821
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley.	36.18952001336017
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried elizabeth.	26.177474590974334
"i have no right to give my opinion," said wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise.	29.651654490887694
intending to trace their route.	101.0203749000611
they are wanted in the farm, mr bennet, are not they?"	39.04998423417751
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning.	15.232190966307433
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	22.397968781669054
this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	32.03433300093561
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	26.541436945553844
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with him, if i were you."	26.836612092628396
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	19.11255359844487
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	16.421841813094524
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	24.639299801626365
"exceed their income!	154.9400264585071
"oh!	271.02234991487614
thought elizabeth.	536.6354521724977
mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	33.035161075261804
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	17.109429981352378
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	28.131932963718274
"and this is your real opinion!	74.12926965145851
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	36.05826004193564
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do."	21.77868062208548
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."	23.9426112783215
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?	17.817037592040904
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	12.546496312604424
but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	25.746281259595293
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	16.811522409836304
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	26.592079246157276
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	21.333478337915686
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"	34.72100662512136
she resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	20.99226773530578
and her neighbours at lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only set that down, as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	13.184997782630745
"you did!	315.47131496789655
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	16.81122163993376
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	50.77569186146066
a few weeks, he believed.	112.01795647794852
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.	26.872107789367114
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.	16.427480361352252
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted.	108.40255229921938
in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	13.07646526834815
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.	33.969382869246196
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	31.016137987447216
lord!	1082.6196307403645
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	16.694562689686236
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.	33.9482456205325
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley.	36.38951447422042
"indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!"	17.277084282622567
but he found, in reply to this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	21.520320353564703
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.	22.51032221475147
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long.	42.984478131403186
but let me advise you to think better of it.	56.69486450643167
she answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, "my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	26.380633134034603
you do not look well.	120.86242902105535
she will be taken good care of.	76.3599916873266
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	100.40052797386801
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	11.18347827800808
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips's manners and politeness.	23.2580400907943
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	25.344844368578322
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."	19.793108470481446
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.	39.431439104710286
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, "if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."	15.19973788162027
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.	23.651525829652613
"you have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	30.278223813678714
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.	20.308737745289097
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."	11.11293431151991
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	18.30618703095528
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	70.99691011546041
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former.	25.839145110189282
"dearest jane!	283.23299273880133
jane was not happy.	227.81882868256037
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	40.03386311150788
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	37.08357505799836
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	20.08343707261605
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	16.869579259630957
her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	25.084947505228314
but that is nothing to us.	120.9934294479266
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."	26.9707056452517
we had better not mention it.	98.47556686144861
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	32.9534536613095
"yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	24.185619791037837
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	52.44830488325868
mr bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.	20.414789753564136
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country.	17.099933742227538
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	78.47332430608684
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	25.538285486277115
"you began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas.	28.24569148635703
i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing."	12.998125116676245
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."	17.077190270776732
lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	13.425253192330242
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls.	30.182022563764505
two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	14.069610492111796
had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	17.52369760415037
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	26.804612038333396
jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman."	26.274625512332193
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	20.613831260982053
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	47.383660674195866
it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us.	29.189578716632795
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!"	51.204167527112645
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	14.746607673978641
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	15.668558681029262
what news?	490.3327302585504
the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	26.237582836444
chapter i.	460.7207479767084
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	60.547858777522165
if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."	25.28259298627609
"you observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."	19.102260492434453
"my dearest sister, now be be serious.	56.922818344144225
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	19.85801427426997
you know not what you are about."	74.95248798168339
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	14.106596337092745
"but so we all do.	86.55106186455465
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness."	46.0431286975969
not that i think charlotte so very plain--but then she is our particular friend."	28.849607874405432
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	39.357780266798365
"good gracious!"	123.42674243008422
"a little."	149.54546075647772
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	21.84229597031967
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"	15.335942694956675
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	22.78351029396147
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	27.31753689169053
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself."	46.99633435445971
mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	18.22442311871417
"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	21.19288053258013
you dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."	15.121057958621904
who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	15.301440806720151
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	36.74164536913269
now what have you to say?"	100.52639145709082
i thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town.	30.08638542346728
if he fears me, why come hither?	65.3105948511277
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	23.904366209847204
i have no such injuries to resent.	62.56801994424399

her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.	41.81774248051128
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	15.473857545629665
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	28.111718641641797
she saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	20.217271048520704
good heaven!	433.5419595448023
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	28.168457603587612
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	30.903237629037342
a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone.	41.040300924692175
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable.	54.16772955818201
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	29.13321924438887
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	14.239702256012091
and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?	20.22373860900655
"oh!	271.02234991487614
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	21.5782386186876
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	18.123377043682023
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them.	37.30382320610888
and what sort of table do they keep?	50.43490616104031
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.	16.52086536757318
but i must write no more.	104.50521290266362
she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then observed, "your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	15.285513593182456
"i do not know.	99.8872628277269
i am sure you will be very comfortable there.	51.469241303824916
oh!	714.3130208232782
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley.	33.289513971490656
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	32.30678542154356
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	46.24540270558713
a most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	41.13008180869457
he was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	16.657335768683442
'lady catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	23.539099860468276
people do not die of little trifling colds.	62.64067407818383
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	23.829012818585795
we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	24.379702887328918
she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!	17.65361507716318
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."	14.891181581289324
the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	23.432389052620184
you must contrive to send somebody.	82.45325533038903
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	27.912859687405177
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.	20.79425381291125
"it must have been his sister's doing.	61.90416811265194
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	29.08980879781092
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	60.15909092196749
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	36.81915499240013
are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	54.975475853663234
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	40.12712151074925
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?"	59.853465520613994
i can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, i have seen nothing of it."	23.794186190989066
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	17.661929373510283
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	16.313213103160678
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	61.34827671640154
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	17.23202746624362
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	13.073816972056058
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?"	18.531876929856722
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	64.174620493975
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	16.865518148470937

consider mr collins's respectability, and charlotte's prudent, steady character.	38.918765634520284
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more than i ever look into."	18.382728505866062
his belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	23.16702810360658
"what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy?"--said jane as she finished it.	29.827481765580846
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	22.47542844830879
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	65.69772489068016
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	14.16798072177694
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	34.682417960120745
but, lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or jane at most.	29.43830791936109
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street.	11.440619563813
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	61.779288551269765
"how despicably have i acted!"	56.31474742737925
painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	40.915229724408775
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	29.97639731885063
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?	31.459620588449692
i have by no means done.	85.17711389437486
unfeeling, selfish girl!	148.52187939075125
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed.	10.904633681173012
as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	20.525232891158428
dear, dear lizzy.	162.6417924059446
it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	15.176549962490165
now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"	37.00193242768858
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	47.56225068229051
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	26.667132839006143
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	13.076248035487835
i should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	28.858089472649528
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins, and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	31.20952167839348
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	14.800132383912716
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.	22.38420035780423
she was ashamed to think how much.	84.32897047065106
"yours, &c."	62.32468477929475
i did not wink at you."	62.38180177552005
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november 18 th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	11.173321338075814
"wickham so very bad!	126.56369619895747
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army," she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	15.789506556816331
but what does he say of the living?"	60.98343014929997
"my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?"	18.25498870697933
mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, mr wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	17.679575578688894
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say.	23.972747444238095
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	20.982503591601645
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	13.54088013679823
when all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.	20.065412991718006
she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade.	20.99872250899541
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.	19.182908327583238
oh!	714.3130208232782
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	20.157060450184684
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	42.548502496539875
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	34.647576475651114
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."	24.024285874853863
"good gracious!	195.91039972965092
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	21.7036933839738
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy.	32.67834463583581
elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	28.26569526828662
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	60.65882745838133
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	19.990967115680455
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	34.19945524387375
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	20.345935437268086
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."	28.40382301933415
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	16.52863637041079
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	19.914976244971868
well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	26.23759145588648
oh!	714.3130208232782
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them, was expressed towards the two eldest.	19.273096749331405
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	45.415279467008304
by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	16.382488619420776
jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	22.7987048945512
let her go then.	153.24313841226052
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back.	28.852098850311776
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give.	24.618062272009453
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.	19.72815818117662
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	33.03335567387785
this was one point, with regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	25.67594315005693
this was invitation enough.	149.8031636907411
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	33.89783747036471
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."	31.093642333031028
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	17.716605436057264
he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	18.026727396917302
but gracious me!	265.4172573366995
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	40.21232831631488
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	23.875505989101338
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	15.123624423970902
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	14.052574771764629
pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."	20.94261465493225
elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	44.59184485715067
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	14.98806260780056
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	30.671417973975153
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was."	36.85822334686625
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	29.621281939650114
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	48.00294292279885
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	35.181870438488545
good gracious!	394.82566060286973
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due."	23.537477171841108
i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, i am thus rejected.	26.97996333827745
it must be an amusing study."	65.59222425581216
it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	14.98802925846532
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	16.544100692770616
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	20.78486656245708
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	22.06036692088286
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no longer.	19.057449541597872
those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.	14.294037911866198
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	17.34495995092291
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	39.23389668776056
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	14.197251881810994
oh, that i knew how it was!"	82.39279001055152
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.	22.102011154567883
they were hopeless of remedy.	97.07895430295564
and to be kept back on such a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."	19.737831915423588
had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."	15.402570925652416
"that it ought not to be attempted.	87.88914135389408
she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.	44.7201041942596
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	43.88941949653883
and she rose as she spoke.	112.08078850006125
"no; but it must be done soon."	62.049550195023194
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine.	15.332787014084824
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	15.506784676108127
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	23.856184792927436
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	23.868823733236287
i often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	25.29055757333747
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done.	36.62693182275347
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	28.918375353748086
you wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	39.758320986864156
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	23.983549058878467
"and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london!	25.71872189398352
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	35.30843893914138
i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family."	15.702284598744953
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	42.31578537947157
"she is a great deal too ill to be moved.	47.28478174413894
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	18.448541740771496
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	27.16070179181172
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	20.83218103937593
lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!	34.69510719240733
1.f.3.	77.29786367167914
about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate; and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	12.968049896137051
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i demand it of your justice.	17.666108693188068
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.	31.72646713550377
mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	15.94860331318732
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	39.26364240025715
"that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."	23.742346039376418
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	30.595944702743765
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address.	18.22992767451625
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	15.444959237187929
she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.	15.281171436303882
as for their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	22.515060873411272
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	28.213170046791777
said she.	402.44987842688954
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"	42.62501721769013
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that.	37.137767102389795
her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	45.83079123937706
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter.	26.397595282129714
her reflections were in general satisfactory.	107.98049151660288
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	90.05789011035253
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	26.950273589786743
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."	16.174719861409613
the express was sent off directly.	66.89089789797553
chapter vii.	412.12655134874456
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	19.90241500847562
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	33.19116778886459
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	79.12056911997595
it was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	29.678249160753616
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them.	43.26893732727112
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	50.98154608091686
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	16.09741951049045
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.	18.0123073331277
they will never be distressed for money.	74.33849736871568
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	57.37487908864371
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	20.66102856429113
chapter x.	412.12655134874456
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	26.072276811472907
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	37.59783658259987
"certainly.	517.6204103519555
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear.	25.295554460660544
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	13.737517975635004
and, above all things, keep mr bennet from fighting.	36.136426860988266
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an argument, and want to silence this."	22.093235497502015
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	15.618896472524664
well!	1336.481874172837
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	34.26202031293461
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"	42.888699246197596
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i am the youngest, i'm the tallest."	20.270594643675015
1.f.4.	77.29786367167914
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	74.58445350858977
you know my sentiments."	101.05582557796421
"oh!	271.02234991487614
who could have done less for her?	106.72358375832229
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."	22.480346766163358
it originated in mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	19.17468049354762
here, sarah, come to miss bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	34.60572051650426
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's.	25.807888066781615
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	22.776932887702298
the officer was the very mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	20.888307166261345
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity.	87.18465985763693
we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	34.70098345270313
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	15.964374035657935
"and may i ask?"	81.60787182585383
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."	42.27409894218312
"oh!	271.02234991487614
they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	28.621227121644797
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	21.908490008115137
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth, dovedale, or the peak.	15.375443521386307
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character."	41.126135363241744
"your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.	28.646038514929803
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	58.50152620145391
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	43.28944939212917
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	19.58847913712792
"but what is to be done about pemberley?"	49.88536055950606
"it is wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	18.82218117881395
"and have you heard from him often?"	56.44799629858152
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	27.978003523985894
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	19.907742014802565
i certainly have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	28.141325018903974
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	14.839279865735707
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well."	16.120114388152693
"i did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."	18.54639063341219
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do.	23.449114512676577
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.	24.99812890399547
the rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	19.90509252268979
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	13.760886713519488
and if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	14.654605265912496
"perfectly so--i thank you."	54.365098234896394
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	16.168837226529003
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.	33.17079628007766
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states.	16.422661189466897
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	45.16089040706461
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head quarters.	19.443094873587516
as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	31.363464253496016
it is every way horrible!"	66.26500870038983
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.	22.804394135513057
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	15.604079444474785
"of what are you talking?"	74.6815947963414
what is to become of us!	96.94430189378348
"who do you mean, my dear?	75.35506659565362
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	30.554226777185047
those who chose to be idle, certainly might."	47.30613038829913
but no one can throw any blame on them.	41.344115994401875
with a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	16.052964212268982
at that moment, she cared for no other.	66.8601361588906
from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	12.952220142763197
but now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	35.095646715461925
darcy said nothing at all.	126.97066427096618
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	43.92884232662099
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	17.942754468513748
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	14.854455301331349
let me hear what it is."	83.92032053346526
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	31.227815491897044
only think!	561.4137000792689
you must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what i say.	24.83135650721411
"i have said no such thing.	81.17069329414778
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	12.237962645212594
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	17.331726480991783
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner.	72.26500570369207
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	12.636641025280879
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	18.695734262294
no, no, you shall not deceive me.	67.46738898573221
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there.	21.791665308232872
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	53.16742610464179
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	40.232553382871465
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.	16.504758658757122
i was never more annoyed!	98.89849430215105
"that is a failing indeed!"--cried elizabeth.	44.977764518343754
"would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	14.39084903843464

too much, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject?	19.910717936270533
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	45.09186867296083
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks.	17.746635894269875
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining in, observed, "yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her.	16.902320477337952
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	52.88190566341097
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to mr collins!	15.12930964239994
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	16.17405202348663
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	24.198450644479323
"what do you mean?"	71.42243811144034
does your charge give you much trouble?	78.14676475917993
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	17.207623483497056
it amazes me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.	26.805142766489325
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.	18.956060961013264
i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	34.02699068173115
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	39.39358939592005
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	16.09584962374271
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame.	32.125494995250605
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	38.55351431090529
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins instead!	21.95784573478383
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance.	39.75872059340337
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.	15.563595265494836
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it."	17.14401637770154
it had better have happened to you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	33.75617350413488
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	44.36303524064032
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."	37.92834374764225
mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	20.687200969852373
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet.	42.10225543107174
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	33.16064370700076
nor was darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	28.016743847552043
said her mother.	266.2959607028958
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.	28.83598497041783
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	13.947066820788724
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	61.543840772143945
we shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	19.299759385962478
"having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	14.886958056869597
"i will not be interrupted.	105.86012729357294
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."	16.410347348898828
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield, and she blushed as she answered, "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.	18.61446214605112
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan."	22.436304485482466
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	19.756540817121003
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	18.191218585915724
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.	13.28931911769071
he owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	33.92747394584736
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	22.37622051506662
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley, and her being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	17.855538279255452
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	16.38450752627849
after a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	37.30685884261852
chapter xv.	412.12655134874456
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	57.31248401834667
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	43.312668715301726
she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.	35.27222422439465
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	25.53121175304041
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him."	15.340925207725395
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	28.050247656880984
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."	22.435338361004007
"true," said mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."	18.526295518074335
she looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	42.17995310082722
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	34.265171226315886
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	45.23058746697299
"yes, or i will never see her again."	53.06543752534802
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	31.818692618390227
she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	16.684891194971765
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	27.929824356017228
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	21.18132484004733
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	40.30579035333341
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	55.179850138735304
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	27.973782111551316
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	77.83354687652958
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	24.659281621817527
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.	28.359948489004967
"i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."	16.739169812374836
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	35.41213916728135
one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	10.953692302427005
but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."	30.929322861316546
in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	25.690627540574546
chapter xvi.	440.93963481431535
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	16.935139008104713
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	17.522431079786955
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	19.445989299333146
i know you will contrive it all."	60.02601258744885
their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	33.60671031919265
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	14.335627358912832
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!	45.17635556467494
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	17.347263814549127
i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	21.944499211007493
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?	39.42046235594573
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	46.90272401329825
and then when we came away it was such fun!	52.89215488891603
say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	38.47713810827376
have you heard from my uncle?"	81.00154536848197
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."	20.515860608881905
not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	17.137690644526398
with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord!	13.981171473993658
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	54.4558098528184
'ah!	494.87448206743176
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	18.291618428880835
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	22.549461057448823

"no, lizzy, that is what i do not choose.	53.64924700141861
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	20.05010586548565
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	38.74488543955878
mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	17.406172468006456
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.	32.74226705082013
"there can be no doubt of that.	74.23181236365795
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	16.482945833796546
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	15.339074435820603
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	30.23175588759055
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	41.75396522462338
chapter iii.	412.1199797521609
"my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza," said charlotte.	32.525569945146096
"really, mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.	32.71689881032382
dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--"there, mrs bennet."--my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england.	9.892106626106148
on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	29.703944209539785
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	11.466867796999868
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	24.410967291633455
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	33.319511103878845
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	16.556112833635805
chapter xvii.	440.93963481431535
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	75.10789805300031
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	21.358274837878657
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	39.61030387551344
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	30.883579375443777
if there were but such another man for you!"	46.40555426536373
mrs bennet's best comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer.	34.0722429577274

while in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!	18.6103669024785
but will they make you happy?"	54.81986313582719
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	25.17053046327526
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	27.11729524763758
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	50.61262139296854
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	22.205982637334685
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	41.17766181161055
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	18.64883363626429
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	16.434846735424806
her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	15.378834522827622
in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind."	44.29501787291585
this cannot be!--engaged to mr darcy!	66.45588329542996
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	24.912629569623967
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	14.75364811262567
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	15.46132995294494
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	29.91344132168236
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	16.541906894288434
he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning.	19.230839946171024
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which she had refused to give.	13.123371218816821
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."	39.00559321312481
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.	13.734300739780691
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	25.957856832710817
teaze him--laugh at him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	32.82277462979113
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."	20.70722588943389
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.	41.43120315604785
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	33.11354894941155
i want to talk very seriously.	95.8684181835449
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	15.490709312323956
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	19.096641527518617
will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him.	18.823376860974456
perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease.	26.829871431496823
"i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield.	34.59519571935341
they must all go to brighton.	90.98694580257396
thank heaven!	464.03223253152356
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr bennet coolly observed, "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	20.294052138627066
and what do you think she said besides?	75.5801320545381
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	26.853712805387932
respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.	29.456716317313905
such a charming man!--so handsome!	61.88266121345751
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in her.	19.657406040341034
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	18.105313778534317
but if you are really innocent and ignorant, i must be more explicit.	38.22560331447133
brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	16.53409675088075
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy.	42.25298538601471
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	19.246589409659553
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	40.76401494689488
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	21.324407119943807
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.	27.222961057373816
when mrs bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	24.765574659591874
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	39.33277241996059
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	15.57026232005727
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	17.98820232865391
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever i saw.	23.03279610665148
she will not be able to help calling."	53.09592257065027
we were married, you know, at st clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	30.229940192580354
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	15.10663483974583
chapter xiii.	440.93963481431535
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	38.34223678647451
these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	21.02060318382548
she approached, and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.	21.022839951208976

anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	33.592532736912524
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."	24.373469690121098
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	32.87781289832416
it was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	28.254298519470986
how you must have hated me after that evening?"	43.97109389547038
her answer was warmly in his favour.	72.26136227945825
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	17.25311700914716
"i know them a little.	120.80780408307385
they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	25.58461623366683
what will you think of my vanity?	120.55285342229033
"ah!"	226.12424022895036
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted."	49.64169582867686
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	27.3811467009594
he took the hint, and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "that will do extremely well, child.	21.392911695489268

you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	28.846913204674358
and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and mrs long.	43.73565497380856
about ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	22.440163517693648
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said elizabeth.	30.593390823024063
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	55.898921920623344
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	17.669584551558145
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	18.18534323966377
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."	25.37992114806357
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn would come in the evening.	20.929631810591417
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	48.064115869150314
if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	23.85167329690078
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out.	18.426604132107954
mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	24.25613869345477
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	26.873377837420318
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!	44.35674842146715
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	24.554747382918332
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."	25.177742033668906
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	37.16238222502354
he has also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."	14.857062377778911
"mr darcy!"	153.73930285684403
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy.	53.55940614936613
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	44.461685818953995
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	17.599847952162992
"not the slightest.	189.27923258645754
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	24.651685804527236
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them, at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	14.27088621025102
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	15.796237599241687
i wonder what he can be doing there."	65.63151197131148
i congratulate her.	251.58053986677962
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	13.692744458705997
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	96.65990242205179
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	16.633422263815245
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	21.359819070647553
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	42.87081516624202
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	21.77974885346981
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	15.86730095015361
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent.	18.822054392502793
for god's sake, say no more of his partners.	46.84268176784553
"we can all plague and punish one another.	35.55850497879293
no."	383.3409936989433
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	43.7170001959258
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	22.325920720407478
egerton, military library, whitehall.	63.20327016129113
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before.	23.673625060042234
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."	22.313086979430434
it is useless to talk of it."	56.60807414837626
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	19.585227345885926
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!	17.467882705791585
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london.	21.881340160227992
"can you deny that you have done it?"	55.22524865353689
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	15.432197481672604
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance."	54.67548015032333
but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	42.032198371636454
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	16.881635901154176
he danced only four dances!	105.10934903191877
i never was.	252.5770465204085
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."	24.040048196102454
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	22.450617049821076
they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for mr darcy.	18.158424358252642

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	17.21024502153475
if i have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.	12.720689076721392
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	20.91696968773475
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	24.72514847930191
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	19.535471641575793
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together.	16.709602500577375
you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner.	38.40315338189788
i hope he will overlook it.	82.0653294574089
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it.	83.94385870537441
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	60.17485550226634
"let me be rightly understood.	73.26150272086886
the possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	33.74572535844631
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday.	18.151786725526584
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	23.282486360832493
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	21.516580801761826
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	38.46405039356186
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to scotland."	15.91135646086901
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	19.36646421994897

"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	48.550011348942164
at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends--whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."	16.70301449077633
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s regiment."	32.443704744135516
my dear, dear lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	23.193044654692383
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	21.298003303951692
"never, sir."	119.9052422706998
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	36.674636380680056
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	31.484316967502007
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	21.579289389359342
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."	16.72612821136214
stay, stay, i will go myself.	84.54445317921204
mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	27.92087803254942
chapter xx.	494.93800552600936
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	29.661870763200366
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	18.79957593048799
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	59.34587367270323
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	33.57843435804079
she had been unwilling to mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.	21.714556192218538
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	25.241088537110492
he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	24.668714715643173
but do not be cast down.	106.58150581198299
"she is my youngest girl but one.	62.30499153497857
send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	30.76441154978894
wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	33.45507690873999
how are you all?"	156.6210908681328
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	34.12704295623184
it must be my uncle's doings!	77.59028706929462
what could she mean by it?	109.03485916866055
a clear ten thousand per annum.	73.06692428103136
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	19.60654516300919
oh, no."	189.9752161959676
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham.	12.816592105523762
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	19.76647974663881
what did colonel forster say?	124.25362258858597
so much the man of fashion!	111.55154204075309
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	17.755124502660895
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	48.928115141037175
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country.	16.531264559856236
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.	18.053797135658943
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them.	15.320337410445772
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	26.39408040805583
though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	28.641946790900747
she certainly did not hate him.	104.39833359356619
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	16.6983244799019
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	13.241901223025796
they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."	21.491443896717264
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	67.13025177861323
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.	43.96182898797467
there was no arguing upon such a project.	67.93879199688432
kitty and me were to spend the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, mrs forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	15.597788731994184
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	25.192969718005
"oh!	271.02234991487614
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	37.48017255182642
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	39.25237940070985
next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	36.106086583965315
no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.	21.520194185782195
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.	20.788107901027068
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	17.47471137919653
in that case he would return no more.	61.327159636854184
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself.	13.875569235740878
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."	15.600177956559758
mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley never stirs without him."	13.514487213807458
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure.	109.13092555671068
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."--and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins."	14.473338334184387
he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.	35.31788163862712
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	19.963102290100668
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy?"	38.98298297418225
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at present i have not room to do them justice."	18.759173822886126
i have not the smallest hope.	76.32888372632043
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence.	14.549775249405442
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	8.879968759145765
miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	38.47932244399588
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.	29.10043536177435
"you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	27.09739610966545
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	20.60867767251586
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i laugh.	40.25258571429863
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when he put his letter into her hand!	21.457980884647018
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."	27.963113604405432
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	34.255120176064224
kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	26.13514453732928
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	14.797521417166564
cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	37.37744461156379
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and i hope you will consent to be of the party.	27.119912836234555
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.	44.101417998780136
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	18.100625433887192
she then took a large house in edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	23.03920754384449
and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	23.781873957120048
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	15.879958162744307
he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	27.951907091401242
while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.	14.500173462847036
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	15.468318492022998
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	33.64853071417542
"this is not to be borne.	93.81485970570711
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	21.685484451216627
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	19.62459375181307
i saw them the night before last."	69.56473201736199
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	39.47632493841226
"a man who has once been refused!	49.65406053074459
no arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	15.660477842212547
let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	36.85379739762266
we have not met since the 26 th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield."	22.86173421892553
i roused, and interested you, because i was so unlike them.	57.1473472901672
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	37.52708889766346
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	30.974731489817596
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	24.58711188991046
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield.	40.07473562222991
two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	16.46560035975164
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner.	31.02298532095198
his temptation is not adequate to the risk."	66.11706347079702
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	67.11991944208589
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	22.514208025779194
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	15.867154064039067
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	23.149286264275293
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f.	54.93992087430724
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."	26.31170177987667
my aunt told me so herself on saturday.	65.42949969588511
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	42.42166076675033
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	36.07193889857121
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr wickham and herself.	33.21510412269161
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	23.697223104638702
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	15.515751855111443
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	29.056954878557583
"sure he will not leave london before he has found them.	45.482603457401616
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	25.578866486750485
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	35.05000792548348
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	15.25749941167678
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.	30.791459570817388
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	35.39136636151904
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.	34.269534847509156
"and do you like her?"	81.00656628327236
arguments are too much like disputes.	96.31255452746537
cried elizabeth.	401.65552359617834
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i despair.	23.004239722603362
forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."	28.344878221545308
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	23.119216790138935
my dear hill, have you heard the good news?	50.26971844565101
a great deal more passed at the other table.	54.71959888345073
mamma would like to go too of all things!	73.7271605735281
how are they even to be discovered?	111.76295041939467
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	20.283576950455906
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me!	28.551871581368943
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!	52.8167919011008
"i hope not so.	127.10721534503243
he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	42.95162170315196
it was over at last however.	107.4897551054468
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	42.98340560849737
is nothing due to me on that score?	80.88089356272945
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	20.96861150646624
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	19.917775052387228
his coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	26.228568917820606
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	18.134243297064064
but slyness seems the fashion.	90.57682747883912
they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	14.891710924775802
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	35.06954341035179
"we never had any governess."	78.8126554043858
they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities.	15.973160234734921
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they?	27.489366763759797
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	53.1981617007218
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth, "i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	16.997987555009736
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	26.309461095438582
oh!	714.3130208232782
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i am strongly inclined to hope the best.	16.054948162573847
"undoubtedly.	526.5642670343125
what are we to do!"	97.72583679319642
mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	25.26723123395472
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you joy?"	24.669814905043
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	38.305645535242185
women fancy admiration means more than it does."	54.68285555673949
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	29.031646456447486
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i assure you there are many amiable young women.	15.53329421583623
they are not married, nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	20.353949026049214
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	22.440438702700472
they met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	57.21269507905968
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	33.00395855605765
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	17.548923702681027
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!	28.20119053227714
"mr darcy, you see, is the man!	79.67256728048118
her report was highly favourable.	108.72906029496046
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.	17.603789933537914
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and miss bingley.	31.40686673176626
said he, with a look of doubt.	61.7660798123224
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday.	29.11561275029187

we were always good friends; and now we are better."	47.922427221441005
chapter xvi.	440.93963481431535
"la!	521.6693691156485
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	36.254845320021886
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	12.738303871167727
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	41.95177492496747
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."	41.56182971764251
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	33.445504405109006
without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	19.53989849864948
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my waking mr hurst."	19.2878501155826
nobody wants him to come.	170.2795123655893
he takes them now for people of fashion."	40.62466454621948
the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	14.258836823419387
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	31.576525258619363
"i should not mind any thing at all."	46.37024862923831
how he must have felt it!"	104.68420436765489
supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?	29.519021640824782
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days.	35.22309146962908
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	53.66203283529812
is it true?"	142.89194079261534
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming.	80.15364553554868
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	18.183595015447697
"my real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me.	26.04650822098479
the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth.	24.90011208226965
"my object then," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	16.923677379556256
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	22.288812983374967
but you do not know all.	113.90352441288765
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	16.731913537171824
it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	17.189894459852688
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	17.982119939689326
in talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	26.949818289837232
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	18.625131354041116
from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	14.248078172413619
"perhaps we might be deceived."	79.94089928037914
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	15.097805751284715
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	38.12438394250077
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	11.767641182959641
our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	16.691611739876063
catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	14.895504981056593
why is not every body as happy?"	74.57618555949152
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	18.23958321344171
but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	23.360645596416045
i told mrs collins so before you came.	70.12735208564754
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	20.751310839378103
he was exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	16.76577633426597
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.	21.57141946539199
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.	22.924854320905947
my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	22.979969072406696
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars.	25.795034616431266
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	45.64160940577114
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	31.799999424419177
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg: 1.e.1.	21.322454197290376
"implacable resentment is a shade in a character.	60.97956336981989
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	80.8828442151011
"as often as i can.	121.28415440313663
my youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	18.687430702046363
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself."	43.03046640566326
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."	27.049867137381142

their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	29.627441199483513
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	78.77969699572267
"what do you mean, hill?	64.08945387440258
"it is not mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life."	26.42990386444116
they were to be off as soon as possible.	60.505573465054255

she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	42.77195464052229
three daughters married!	287.43946426857485
how unlucky!	548.3982659357306
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	22.377643382000276
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	47.97753670402942
there was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	45.38407217423461
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	19.030448772144297
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	61.054366671739686
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.	28.433454506544415
she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	22.06392322260039
however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	29.2680185156911
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	14.863639190674567
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.	16.55337513137647
"what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	44.16055220282129
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr darcy's steward.	14.919957038869407
mr bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house.	21.18784424204591
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!	19.45778467585785
she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.	27.16351823442733
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i was uncivil?	37.550619062401516
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	58.707229135948126
balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	32.750909892671785
and so, i suppose, they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	29.064976214235855
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	17.459632620647024
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"	17.30524581154353
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	50.979559542010776
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.	45.13900475307857
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	89.45362405314059
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	55.321595525248114
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	28.28806317204322
bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	24.227589395119
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am not one of them.	30.583811901678683
she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	17.686967351252076
in understanding darcy was the superior.	129.70743450506956
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful."	22.104555106128497
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	27.036571956289627
"yes; to the last.	124.90221676829003
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	37.2745950192363
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy.	21.11675361270659
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."	23.38266550101109
"but i was embarrassed."	97.1562363312762
mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to-day?	36.84617189548608
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.	18.12623312060069
unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	24.51456860657619
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	23.48374447950875
charlotte the wife of mr collins, was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	17.450223849298208
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter.	34.86375210083671
"what do you think?	129.72022048510007
shall you like to have such a brother?"	82.34019356492345
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	16.52396802969738
she is almost three and twenty!	80.08135735766939
they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	30.945608035967826
"i cannot believe it.	114.22844288448873
it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has never seen the view."	29.95800591223506
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	31.39523083390976
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	15.598112086022928
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	105.22876144741495
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun."	46.399980619466426
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "are you pleased with kent?"	16.102923244071402
a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	25.934402953910343
you alluded to something else.	103.1655037576516
chapter xxi.	494.93800552600936
but, lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."	33.63055055837835
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.	14.004542505294266
you must send john with the young ladies, mrs collins.	47.08138050507459
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."	18.078608009466205
put them next to your great uncle the judge.	49.8234704185688
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	36.46950272366731
his letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.	23.607654672430517
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	55.12573494597124
that he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	35.055945337831155
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received!	18.616743205733037
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	18.93765133556131
she received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.	17.318484150796543
mr what's his name.	103.71783445156684
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr bingley, if she could.	30.151811999423924
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--a short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again.	21.147547981901464
shocking!"	529.3910769784948
it was all conjecture."	108.41923735405318
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	47.736090603936525
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	21.45693879747903

for your sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss bennet?"	13.670856533810339
oh!	714.3130208232782
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	18.5089384164044
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	20.05489264985181
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	21.793257887897283
when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	13.100867316309097
cried elizabeth; "but how could that be?--how could his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	18.22676077256171
it is of all subjects my delight.	69.24933525028332
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	16.482555435697133
he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	23.233456166461764
my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!	35.000766394514116
it is of no consequence.	112.34763318981632
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day.	13.859518203638762
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."	16.957315431405682
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	62.76518976591967
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not return it.	38.686971772606334
he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	30.295154855009763
chapter xvii.	440.93963481431535
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.	15.373732895277893
these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	22.82095613336208
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	36.368404374924935
she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	27.904906126081855
"can it be possible that he will marry her?"	47.084278014050824
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	46.1166427329933
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	16.066610519194352
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it.	21.86432505514886
"oh!"	168.74486172860762
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent.	17.8855925533011
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	19.125273019676797
this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	23.40662049517542
his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	16.458476104775837
i will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	31.72954625904944
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	38.20465917655691
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.	24.271610375101584
any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it, if you had rather not.	24.021396043087183
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	72.46471688296788
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library."	20.91400265729545
chapter xix.	440.93963481431535
mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	17.40925973435144
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	28.55952296823339
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.	18.908145144854245
jane was by no means better.	92.37177740204069
not these two or three years perhaps."	52.261262506029695
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	27.581069332271824
she had ventured only one glance at darcy.	56.45093723136053
into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	50.45984817300783
"in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland."	23.569844371492227
let me never see either one or the other again!"	43.75732402640018
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."	42.683706142171346
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	65.38994551032137
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has too much truth.	30.15731309355052
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment.	83.44661686838056
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her.	30.041042781625492
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	17.60566144688748
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."	26.808917107965296
charles, when you build your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley."	26.363681119123346
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.	44.18637280949926
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	15.050637775506829
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	30.76205013920487
have a little compassion on my nerves.	73.34965181977753
they will take care not to outrun their income.	53.30379912152113
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	31.415451143902796
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	55.713953655310696
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	50.115553854300835
mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding.	56.985195493298754
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	42.10864849238348
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.	23.073142401221308
in his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.	14.338382916318196
mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone mr collins began.	31.93949582872541
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	34.8770263848682
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic works.	11.842796851068133
chapter viii.	412.12655134874456
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a kingdom!	36.810748568530265
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"	17.881010217584958
i shall like it of all things.	93.64342159262122
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	21.11074526929302
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i think it will be very tolerable.	17.04299260518455
good girl!	533.5644174389354
said he; "that is rather singular."	57.66352155041209
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	19.56256659100907
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	39.14186390184512
have all her friends left her?"	88.53964733264752
and that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	26.972582318673407
she was gone directly.	166.20303297446657
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	18.030067885039312
elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	26.089689387123883
i always had a value for him.	77.80969768364156
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	35.87837757666063
"exceedingly well.	252.12134776011462
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	21.743189018283026
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	32.49527992302321
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	19.028206328433342
"oh, yes.	133.74988193177563
and gravely glancing at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i shall keep mine to swell my song."	12.73576405891611
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	26.349837999637863
do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	20.855146590135057
his doing so drew her notice.	68.49339714030523
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."	31.63380728440213
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	35.17859891659061
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	23.671756740920692
"yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	30.880045718243142
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly.	94.35523480997698
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.	39.292378180076405
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age."	22.548244080388706
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	30.24793474795318
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	13.188324831816347
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better.	23.288737016551885
but with me, it is not so.	89.7000698331238
pray read on."	178.29972118805688
a flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	11.113091934731429
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings.	14.373834885307735
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.	22.589072372362835
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	53.854353239394555
every body is disgusted with his pride.	74.85644252660033
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	30.83266570382742
chapter viii.	412.12655134874456
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	18.089540984084838
he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	23.835252371682863
he has more to give.	159.509370820056
they are gone down to newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not know how long.	24.916147327425502
her own thoughts were employing her.	73.66123566775477
"and quite alone?	145.415875813745
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	23.34296501065843
when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.	29.027957684046147
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	18.532912476674028
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.	38.87419511528031
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton.	34.26239355403098
said she, as she looked in her face.	81.78831445037112
he does not want abilities.	118.058537837982
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.	18.829091245290325
he really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	40.3301973097439
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage every thing.	16.153102358212944
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at pemberley, mr darcy!"	18.30534953139109
only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	25.819974173594137
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	21.085973863588922
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions.	22.002903181369003
cried miss bingley.	273.8228794503451
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."	35.06779363069371
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is about."	27.134948122242616
they are all for what they can get.	87.05564949290414
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	60.75581851119062
heaven forbid!	524.6677811610797
said elizabeth.	370.63871968949104
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."	17.32643384076795
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	24.829768716256883
"oh!	271.02234991487614
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.	18.417091853122997
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	31.36008240637776
she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.	24.80546527390933
there was also a postscript to this effect.	50.70490067091647
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office."	14.401777404227005
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	16.344585204549535
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of you."	45.81848394017528
of course, we hope that you will support the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.	12.698357690530319
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	47.282937182841366
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	14.305616303198093
thought she.	539.8959926723436
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.	24.502406839225625
his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	41.284968955278444
but i will not repine.	124.1754455705048
but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the room.	23.382846920732064
as a child i was taught what was right, but i was not taught to correct my temper.	25.772195534956307
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	22.30894420533663
let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."	17.6401031976477
"he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."	15.799909004187656
their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	29.697123605619254
they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	14.619575006769534
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.	12.745179108162407
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah!	21.960349964662527
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.	16.623810201372997
"i am, dear sir, &c.	40.69499714511493
there is one point, on which i want your advice.	56.79720896850167
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.	37.75445128555674
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	73.72854148798089
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	19.576657641716803
mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	25.965830719145778
"books--oh!	137.04478708710033
cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley!	20.04259730093012
"miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	28.134074571984257
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	46.30551517129479
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	17.917628461094996
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	18.23322835441193
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	20.182628672326718
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	21.54509533849592
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.	20.23206107057384
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking openly.	13.702383628799634
there was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	30.549678395871407
it is unaccountable!	210.55276557378116
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i trust i am resigned.	17.88976169999942
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	16.08818359670498
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was ill at netherfield?"	27.17820559204918
it convinced her, that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town.	28.064133010635185
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	49.11553425106605
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	27.957472361772545
"this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	15.780525496892773

you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	18.84156410971155
such a countenance, such manners!	114.91982317913694
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	49.84988046093617
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	30.42609902272454
he is perfectly amiable.	159.87952014233355
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your happiness.	44.22162567315233
"lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	42.3497298565585
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	49.17921185927225
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	78.4507041801456
my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?	32.973358780773864
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	12.901166949327127
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."	15.662251798229185
professor michael s.	251.73347624530686
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."	16.406763205986692
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least.	16.90090165032806
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	27.916249865554633
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	17.173764286500184
[illustration: a vicarage house.] pride and prejudice: a novel.	20.039501420834622
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	42.80801599879562
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective.	33.21238852844031
much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.	17.948332420453998
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.	17.133578605216297
"yes, very different.	122.10687211472239
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	28.52348080061839
having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy.	50.00438203811569
when i went away, i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	28.64516732622414
as for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	16.94981043654886
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	28.811592485321594
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	25.477057009478063
but that is not the case here.	102.67201259146412
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	43.61132403035964
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr darcy!"	33.52342075128944
chapter ii.	494.93800552600936
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."	29.90242402415275
lydia declared herself satisfied.	169.55623830874458
there is a lady, it seems, a mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.	18.35433468188742
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	49.52722135630756
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	47.0612807082223
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	18.447032694010463
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	12.960897940515181
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."	29.91531276592167
elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	15.11713931122992
she really looked almost wild."	67.57624073581086
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.	17.04584537764722
the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	28.725621161296846
console lady catherine as well as you can.	94.77602549419412
they then went away.	157.65906502214145
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady catherine.	29.234217429729785
that tall, proud man."	79.64863232364246
you see how continually we are engaged there.	63.83576816954936
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	19.393641292913976
vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	52.43334398876317
i am so grieved for him.	71.72191434924747
when is your turn to come?	112.18143204376669
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	56.51960255047716
1.e.5.	64.45994739749796
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	14.385443461967533
she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself.	20.105736871436086
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner:-- "you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	19.161372866703232
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	19.787663663690594
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"	18.52198772601596
wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	25.4585884170391
"i never saw any one so shocked.	57.88066012815284
said elizabeth.	370.63871968949104
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	30.69426475759759
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	45.195532764777724
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	33.55959875424584
i do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	26.773048859667238
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	33.92294529275381
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	21.62480089798936
my temper would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever."	17.405203334687727
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered.	48.055070474425676
mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	28.34625487021534
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	27.156101681963907
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	21.058284377421497
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	31.05189387036309
she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza!	20.907189820224456
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	18.59399488825368
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	34.01027052028785
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well.	32.13628753047318
"your's sincerely, &c."	43.22899229250182
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	17.713132840776694
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	26.695960888892913
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	19.55656719263749
chapter iv.	440.93963481431535
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	43.786452480626
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	20.311432453012394
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	26.3383889036451
"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	30.023279316534047
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.	28.987936636352018
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	23.417236491233496
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."	27.412153213498662
elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away.	17.964664218373006
in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	19.800068049411713
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home.	21.02385333588816
they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	39.900587299441476
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	43.495448644972384
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	28.795766183311613
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	20.7840169955349
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself.	15.858720130360457
"she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!	24.531498855274258
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	17.56221093576914
mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	18.125617151551197
"i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter!"	25.68627470000952
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	16.389595128943135
1.e.7.	64.45994739749796
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him."	21.560334497131652
mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.	16.616988672766162
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"	12.796180868386589
he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months.	20.023818527432436
yet he is such a man!"	111.28304355088704
he seldom appeared really animated.	90.68919195967631
i am perfectly satisfied.	135.27031410668704
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."	23.96709580703018
as they drove to mr gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	15.368183073471931
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	16.775740423553682
i was uncomfortable enough.	142.83653200036858
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	20.16660758475115
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	15.09239059566962
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.	34.60327983728887
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	23.23684835649004
never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated to colonel f.	35.48842083365819
very well.	383.269310004233
yes, i call it a very easy distance."	66.11841679372496
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	36.00063891744907
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	34.6512836366243
there was no want of discourse.	95.79223256106027
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield.	21.86851756276365
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	16.709637786513532
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	29.542890771485045
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	33.10400379926406
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	61.53925076892926
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	13.426184934779254
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	14.709670545007635
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	27.199286574969488
in this danger kitty is also comprehended.	57.97218206132215
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	41.47476124301723
it only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	24.47386896399028
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.	18.364291668830464
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.	26.102668212144962
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	42.0204359420057
"it is no such thing.	97.88214208767391
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	18.51509842391055
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."	30.885927347594112
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	18.34333741767269
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	40.4743785969898
chapter i.	460.7207479767084
"that you certainly shall."	91.5197773243627
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health.	21.66482833943406
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	19.322115979913907
he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "just as you please."	29.936524785290178
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	65.74683459605085
"but why all this secrecy?	96.80900578752714
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	32.71683148495088
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	36.00960024444756
"not one."	178.1152759015924
"my dear friend, "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	14.931531629239796
is she handsome?"	127.59142933381868
it was then disclosed in the following manner.	71.35246992829967
"indeed i am.	190.4396984109216
it was first broken by mrs annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	14.385003167753819
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	40.99705431134017
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	36.53363546519512
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	67.20692607870194
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."	15.281928516445944
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	23.122584635352705
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	40.70372568571617
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.	30.431181579637723
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	45.181987423123
i did for you.	169.86790024580154
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.	15.933048122922171
"i think she will.	144.09050418932452
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	39.4393820947777
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!	36.269986952716394
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire.	31.033965097671853
about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	27.173335471911663
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes.	21.971614124201206
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.	14.332829276946795
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	18.487922175246577
it was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."	32.490973860649135
she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	18.983043993172537
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	12.556382406711082
bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	40.369606403145546
your reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' those were your words.	17.23349893789241
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	16.448883387621095
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	14.015773124900885
i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	27.604643712565757
he studies too much for words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	27.359382234586608
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	15.49064482021548
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt.	20.513836562952978
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	20.416518529812087
this son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	15.703491509485902
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	20.011439840903734
i will think no more about him."	66.07028033156324
but it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."	27.62808598619652
the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?"	36.04113465295348
what do you keep winking at me for?	58.814595374210256
repeated mr bennet.	355.0485496120876
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	11.968816532177357
had i known what i ought, what i dared, to do!	52.41041065428997
it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	22.87767973787764
it was all pride and insolence.	85.69920835139371
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	34.02284796729784
where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	69.48706895568996
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	15.37502153826845
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.	17.979361628369215
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth: "my dearest lizzy, "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	15.321000584493817
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	16.76828460573305
it was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	26.135378930124254
she related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	36.483883331425396
oh!	714.3130208232782
"one of them does."	108.19544840089691
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	38.775685338050835
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane.	22.357821403247204
the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	18.388418768005533
these recollections will not do at all.	93.58133252496259
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	16.771962217962777
brother-in-law of wickham!	371.96807934976624
as the day of his arrival drew near, "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	31.38131245895057
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	18.157559084722568
lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	13.573801575114041
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	15.876632038200881
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	35.50279844561682
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing to him.	42.76595952773684
from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	25.00762933616331
on finding mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"	18.51121024172458
there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	32.60002794828532
"removed!"	252.20652695898357
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.	33.1068613389393
after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	11.870198994847785
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	30.61569298250579
it was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her's.	42.87240859069406
chapter iii.	412.1199797521609
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	58.95175949465798
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."	22.297047784682825
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	30.22280707541777
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	16.4074425425169
well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	25.063769558109936
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	20.536895546748294
widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	13.630901293171993
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.	31.11242192562275
cried elizabeth when she had finished it.	87.94263149163928
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	17.431859955003546
it is admirable!"	140.66010049560498
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."	22.321872514153057
but lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	41.195145919228054
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	33.52407142169191
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	109.08658303374744
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	18.973493032052676
how can they suit each other?--do you know mr bingley?"	36.01216085904562
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	58.56285093367104
mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	30.032665602486283
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	22.913858474656077
i know it to be impossible."	95.75043822215522
on opening the door, she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	14.865624924954624
he shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."	58.76551099935972
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	19.486670193298256
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	48.501660278204525
at length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends."	19.246228269951555
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	38.28073010124501
mrs bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.	15.241374108912817
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	34.709758920273266
i came to you without a doubt of my reception.	66.44887976687087
i now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him.	44.93737370225131
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often do."	27.226670056032457
do not repeat what i then said.	76.40798371674005
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	46.62768882626083
family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.	43.52320600547749
for forty years, he produced and distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	18.479945672640486
the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	11.625404633544786
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by them."	14.1575704659214
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	58.06834076486966
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	17.82058085679391
you supposed more than really existed.	95.56778309531245
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	36.91219992665074
your tempers are by no means unlike.	62.25142540740622
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	26.839799789390874
their fortune on both sides is splendid.	55.77985026259801
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	18.685272124006804
so much the better.	136.7621727066644
"mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	46.69637872421603
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	50.04957732350561
mr and mrs gardiner smiled.	107.02382321172448
i enquired after their brother, of course.	83.60455345996243
he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	21.91566109858173
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	24.82531572646033
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	31.28201061856552
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	47.802916393205365
i hope she will turn out well."	56.93657152054744
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	31.685472299692087
calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	17.149226857621063
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	20.260220945825758
ring the bell, kitty, for hill.	73.84087793490009
"your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	47.19798925864117
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over.	14.105003896574205
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	16.02107440286052
the path just admitted three.	95.26054919991151
"are they indeed?"	99.77816900032686
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all."	32.50522786185246
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.	13.86989757834873
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	62.331448753769784
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."	20.064637526738696
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	28.65763117088766
"indeed i had.	211.4166545891781
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!	37.957207888797754
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	96.43106140969753
the period of expectation was now doubled.	67.11417837563403
good bye.	472.11682211477165
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	45.57462554457973
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	17.305110122918368
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	52.82791611844064
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.	27.801892464189375
i defy even sir william lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	29.975664381909034
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	18.532050018385053
they must be a great loss to your family."	64.12102750955984
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."	22.965413639266284
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	41.898137594083735
"your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy."	17.086678332612394
he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	25.388461976050507
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	27.177415002092758
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	33.71673080540499
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr bingley to her."	35.08349556126895
his sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	16.49911797460886
"did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me?	32.00642111521946
my sole dependence was on you; and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	23.292367114496866
will you come and see me?"	85.65808045828244
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	18.187053005870556
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	34.63684975513577
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	32.61656386989737
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."	16.514603136753006
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	67.60776279486045
"indeed!"	230.59673476054655
he cannot afford it.	146.23025554621256
i grieve to find, however, that colonel f.	54.781020888600416
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	20.245296455612
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."	20.163643653236274
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	20.52761963449386
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	17.89681217182027
and is it really true?	118.84735905552948
your's, very sincerely, "m.	80.7190209132449
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	41.82135709841963
nothing could console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her resentment.	22.510419890338394
perhaps she is full young to be much in company.	70.42529634452828
now is your time.	211.8185260173861
"did charlotte dine with you?"	73.09639903552606
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	31.160509069459415
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall i call it?	23.43760957723227
as long as she stays there, it is all very well.	48.22371411882105
his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	27.84040189587695
"with the officers!"	152.1843797636045
our poor mother is sadly grieved.	77.16903045025597
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.	27.690414360020128
"i certainly shall not.	138.43941867796053
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	24.522246990734388
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	27.9041080918336
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	49.79688531976043
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	17.417099897435367
1.f.2.	77.29786367167914
i hope they will not meet at all.	72.77517699335034
the other is miss de bourgh.	79.22184113899415
there was another reason too for her opposition.	63.4809433483961
he knows of my being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	20.471989193818168
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.	22.840331480052964
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	51.286868812186235
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem.	28.01772603743532
whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.	21.81841314309601
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	41.64364806596642
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	74.67888894418687
yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again.	21.736676946811816
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	17.16196802226318
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	17.48994979487085
elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	17.820286889905244
his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	25.46673995747313
i can recal nothing worse.	94.95160984283268
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	18.827545231450593
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	50.16980118740793
presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	16.868793205594063
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	51.83077859638429
it was agreed to.	160.36981701194847
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."	20.57739673835759
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	32.30898590479766
every thing that is charming!	155.43111068573776
what are men to rocks and mountains?	47.75771284636927
are you going much farther?"	67.56500394338823
mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in reply to his last.	23.455323882724965
at present i am not in love with mr wickham; no, i certainly am not.	43.85303001735
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	45.00039571733599
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	17.291499790148574
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	40.35737562762877
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	18.85712443321656
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	32.44595551248257
repeated miss bingley.	320.8430448757452
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."	26.750444713180542
she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	69.05489238331498
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.	19.16489867698607
"nearly three weeks."	102.03252256832018
"perhaps i do.	209.50738088522556
"insolent girl!"	160.24524819622934
"i hope not."	110.5691178894128
every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	24.643041918237895
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give into it.	25.54820352630886
this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	18.05414688341842
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte, detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	15.956035851849231
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton.	18.04748040118127
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	25.823862184733436
why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"	31.932375258380635
you deserve no such attention.	120.01459871238471
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	52.4574145441876
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	19.509188864102164
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	15.527156575800243
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!	44.23020008907783
it is impossible that he should still love me."	42.78391859709202

when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing farther to wish.	39.799518148389566
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton.	22.712808253829262
how is such a man to be worked on?	75.40574920311201
the happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	18.873969850275
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	19.398095569818846
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	42.091393855994546
what is it about?	196.81490689280028
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	49.77333368475312
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."	12.00251110073351
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	11.816949485432644
as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	20.717676755829924
but that gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."	37.05236978274343
if i had ever learnt, i should have been a great proficient.	48.3792036400207
the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	32.38002264887167
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	41.96997768331408
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	15.536764518699412
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	17.419953853617354
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	17.01589132479136
however, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg-tm work in a format other than "plain vanilla ascii" or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "plain vanilla ascii" or other form.	9.407563435131163
lord!	1082.6196307403645
for such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	12.637933503508737
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	54.5024763577423
on this subject, what can you have to say?	71.47957482429383
mr collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons.	13.04570473915649
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	26.58943976928814
my sweetest lizzy!	250.75411564419767
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	32.06822350330397
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention; the other is charlotte's marriage.	23.632377693355405
is not he a charming man?	84.73573594299371
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."	15.962752951297041
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	23.807572316597962
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	16.07309638392503
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	48.31863821639976
"no, i believe not."	82.02825426035986
he has not an ill-natured look.	88.41354785042599
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"she did indeed, louisa.	116.04720768605445
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing.	36.73764146786478
he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	12.75842838263688
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's way."	32.29824191414389
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	28.969051223565813
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	47.90509028400681
"what, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	47.39370100664337
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	25.56877839467311
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	40.93822633372949
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	24.534930383956837
his understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	36.51981313008219
mrs wickham!	553.5388195600657
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	19.73846700858963
you are lucky in having such a master."	54.67620884483759
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."	14.54002399152142
my poor father!	264.41527695913163
i will read it to you-- "when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	14.100329769616527
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.	25.609281689844675
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	14.416152124951203
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	61.3127993776479
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	23.351662818069713
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	30.989654840176616
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr bingley," said her mother, "i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr bennet's manor.	18.87912835285974
"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	17.98799315722183
what could be more natural than his asking you again?	52.11933700741069
at present we have nothing to guide us.	66.49966489696884
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	56.841774795494985
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	17.322970127774237
but vanity, not love, has been my folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	19.38959520259281
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	43.52806255887833
anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	24.15449615337418
what a contrast between him and his friend!	73.91421176826965
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."	22.63119540266442
nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	19.003057681380504
wont it, kitty?"	194.78683027299593
the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	19.89431364510246
jane was distressed.	259.1286806314578
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."	16.11840975487468
he did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	19.95569556354462
change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."	21.44620105572176
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	16.667521522613942
she saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	32.79837495011388
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	20.88430806630786
he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	17.84134433425468
how well it sounds.	139.6347502647994
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town next saturday."	20.21221003728375
but there are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever to pay him."	21.009611975358418
the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	21.81638137437328
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	36.1868827671091
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	31.371367641122998
why must their marriage be private?	84.03163927726781
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."	24.958022600424062
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."	28.884900925745864
but i confess they would have no charms for me.	52.89936051240293
i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	64.21528388044011
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	25.156837910194287
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	14.774391088305906
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	18.98949281938339
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as you.	36.639503746300825
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	20.380230711884227
"i told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	19.354860308781834
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	15.770268544743653
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	19.825619152929857
i thank you for explaining it so fully.	56.652947939190994
"how so?	260.10553834278164
but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it."	27.279086900584932
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	33.308172218721474
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	23.687839834634396
they insist also on my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.	18.38789264888745
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's?	24.403345647440645
he replied, and was again silent.	95.11956772857489
"ten thousand pounds!	168.9490604175097
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	19.171581841944302
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	24.45560041862985
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.	24.5047720179744
they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	16.33987056503478
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.	78.2339935440149
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	36.20169219487207
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	72.7518943164435
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.	14.086442422518328
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it.	25.75927446939434
chapter xxii.	494.93800552600936
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	14.710577121975609
"oh!"	168.74486172860762
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	37.17929745413033
it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy!	15.704544447301958
lydia laughed, and said, "aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	36.36084957143033
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth.	11.900529243507592
but does not jane correspond with the sister?	85.11720458490869
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states.	35.29848678907153
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	38.75745758684195
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	23.20491948944231
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage.	40.54470395066392
the business was therefore soon settled.	87.54557605742662
both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	115.2256311914326
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	42.170479525948174
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	24.5634945321685
she is grown so brown and coarse!	45.12678783878568
"a gamester!"	115.99991266836938
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner.	31.068054011068543
the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	11.37027219646827
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	19.833905248782216
but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	15.9263748776433
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	32.50625925571485
he has heartily forgiven me now."	51.5188797176959
we will go round the park every day.	59.13057545910804
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	22.01736591204629
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	26.2670012897346
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	37.02339429404879
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	38.68790807372337
indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	16.434154478197737
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	12.79578132437752
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	32.874952364919
but she would not be secure.	118.16053974108469
there was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	16.235402091226874
do any thing rather than marry without affection.	58.2571669089333
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	21.510225063810903
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham's attentions.	16.18383150258694
"i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	25.031528476196097
now, lizzy, i think i have surprised you.	64.17632682133915
but, however, he is very welcome to come to netherfield, if he likes it.	35.95885002679928
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley."	22.467247765516756
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now.	51.70353665271237
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses."	27.792982315343266
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	22.57280604506555
did you see it?"	131.122668856864
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	19.986348803923892
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	45.2039409744232
it distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage.	28.611672515100604
"and mary king is safe!"	57.69185170643446
"this is wholly unexpected.	106.22662187793136
you must learn some of my philosophy.	93.38079119724449
on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	17.13101670828229
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	69.31080054028618
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	31.21702132182569
you blamed me for coming?"	84.16923633860405
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	16.50344918390376
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	37.042648271952025
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	43.13552923253287
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr darcy only, entered the room.	15.04030162946552
it will not do.	181.98120113097406
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	18.40731427023863
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	19.45778184038481
miss lucas is married and settled.	72.16248182815963
his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time.	28.931182656416137
five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	27.621900708640194
her colour changed, and she said no more.	68.1447943534273
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side.	19.071719554311677
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?"	18.540636377763192
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	23.25162057998081
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	15.118134791991178
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	23.259627402201513
well, any friend of mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him."	20.652529499167915
i cannot quite agree with you there.	78.53740920718703
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	68.03492188892098
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	15.524235170372867
colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	23.38887820931338
how acutely did she now feel it.	72.82253077421097
"yes.	413.53623808121466
she answered him with cold civility.	95.29105530063003
mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	16.376899740068442
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	13.896019003948455
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, i am sure you did.	27.561141231964054
she dared not even mention that gentleman.	66.39439934958013
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to befall her?"	22.559139277159353
and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."	19.433732571774364
"but consider your daughters.	109.63281196648002
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north.	23.47512591275604
that is all settled."	120.4990168696519
i thought i should have died.	95.96359018583249
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	18.007591485255148
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns.	12.745384301994305
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	21.404771274480854
"oh!	271.02234991487614
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	31.240972965837777
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	23.994669638557117
his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	14.563800378550868
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife?"	25.57075688120425
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	22.18017440617708
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	21.50352588823533
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am gone."	18.762220553016014
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.	21.763177508408965
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	16.933274982333497
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	28.859572939915825
but it must not, shall not be.	86.47882316458649
it is a pity they are not handsome!	69.63495570458798
lord, how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty!	30.670137843092434
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together.	23.197219221578518
chapter xv.	412.12655134874456
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "project gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9.	9.335016489093125
"the present always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	32.7457894720344
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	19.850368108239117
they are my old friends.	96.19841901778517
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	26.807482766663593
"we have heard only once.	101.22611415692828
but make a virtue of it by all means.	62.149069303556864
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	13.960401570263594
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	29.417878836011333
their situation was awkward enough; but her's she thought was still worse.	33.03871477048604
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter.	16.257133767954876
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	65.8381196123836
society, i own, is necessary to me.	97.75711181370684
he has children of his own, and may have more.	63.76976083425874
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."	23.02994219309998
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	16.371174140866444
but she is nothing to me now.	116.92477556708968
and now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.	21.79286458140458
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	43.515692375785356
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.	25.708113375203
but i hope you will not mind it: it is all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.	21.076091170828786
but it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	28.065546958964983
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	27.937646001259868
but mrs bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	63.33097724538501
she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."	25.869229590519353
his surprise was great.	177.72867294240686
mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	16.484196146185084
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	76.08403979870029
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	69.88081592613229
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the case?"	36.3831703550897
her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	25.80475271381946
there was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.	17.926316160712858
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	32.71072811643213
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	21.80502681766803
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	39.02692927540929
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.	15.906111569304258
i shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance i require."	31.973107208735847
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	31.81431174327123
mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	26.290443253562287
1.e.9.	64.45994739749796
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not know of any prepossession;--her eldest daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	14.271038206763306
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	29.296005688764822
"you go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds!	19.548448947284133
mr jones says we must not think of moving her.	47.28175515586707
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	15.215817931041014
this invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.	48.10354201766813
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	18.266647320772798
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	23.23012658650567
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."	24.572389205828618
but mr gardiner could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.	24.53359151709899
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	16.86578556073613
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	15.94160631695663
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.	22.037607307551554
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	50.102295642941634
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	14.901360140557644
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	24.712944024239704
he cannot know what mr darcy is."	72.78928901202657
did he know of their intending to go off?	75.79515591126908
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	53.60841521106762
i will go directly to mr bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	26.551501688187386
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	14.927848156520824
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	23.577277981761682
human nature is so prone to fall into it!	45.4301258166238
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	37.07968529471922
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.	27.782777330604613
elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.	22.344908631322355
they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.	31.88170959365916
this mrs younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	25.68993941887027
the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.	19.147882362679145
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	19.516907525062603
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.	17.25501392592565
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."	33.91987649803251
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	26.795850393799117
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	24.054493150833274
i am very glad you liked her.	61.86895769665853
"i see no occasion for that.	69.58966562738802
in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	22.718275875423842
"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if i should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	19.562141612262483
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	17.944513759729023
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	27.962857033550392
"has she been presented?	123.25871721110775
however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	38.3241042577877
what felicity!	559.7953603645893
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	18.27979984804491
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	18.242224519537885
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	18.24904382290417
he was always to have gone on saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	32.526966059987004
then pray speak aloud.	148.3237128360178
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	22.933428696482462
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	63.652178488144614
section 2.	384.7872480953786
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	50.495463922696956
"blame you!	261.3853904845678
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	40.668851179038825
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	29.21146517758482
darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	18.467521948403817
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	21.047182536213548
if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	39.83379168071906
cried elizabeth.	401.65552359617834
when she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	15.117619289263066
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	16.809873755287466
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	14.331038055620567
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	50.521805782011896
"merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.	25.935228644612394
"that is his notion of christian forgiveness!	46.00327995038076
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	22.852831461071553
"indeed!"	230.59673476054655
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham.	22.066024059021576
chapter i.	460.7207479767084
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	14.349055762954475
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	19.56663712619591
you have delighted us long enough.	78.85682656794978
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	51.89515726360523
"bingley."	239.57560749801425
it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.	40.44789270251588
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way.	25.26717200855526
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london.	18.401193050395737
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	50.82717993651878
his fear of her, has always operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he has very much at heart."	18.996187841919905
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	21.43368420432055
it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	25.106969577434455
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	13.530755488878425
we will know where we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen.	37.16630351382532
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor i, nor any body, can ever forget.	24.447416976778005
but when they see, as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."	19.632262509881258
miss darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	22.287847874722473
"oh, well!	176.8463243926839
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	24.771290561115407
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	30.98361303124786
but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.	15.011143997854441
but these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	43.896021982425985
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	15.54142817847582
my watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	19.991735205625066
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	17.165868785058315
there, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.	23.850800655748213
oh, brother, how kind you are!	91.92204846610899
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	57.084769853746636
"why will you think so?	117.91463917354666
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	24.354311679712303
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	65.19082028954145
girls, can i do any thing for you in meryton?	78.38623283048844
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	50.45741949124548
i depend on you for that."	100.78470719957083
who attended to you?	262.27240208724027
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	24.39578721054489
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	58.891114421620344
"is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	13.481867338968538
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.	18.217620949444754
one seems so forlorn without them."	53.140433564346644
they had long wished to see him.	84.47903009528233
"what does mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?"	27.631854025936562
not a soul knew of it, but col.	66.03672395468979
his character was to speak for itself.	94.31651562069189
why should they try to influence him?	65.90936758137782
"he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."	22.810961219678305
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor."	45.27590818696677
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of humility.	34.09380825721951
said jane.	445.9682573300528
they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas.	13.503827387825595
"and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"	29.04333499443022
"if i were as rich as mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	20.080495955154742
that is all to be forgot.	144.7966537152793
you and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the party."	21.95914259379905
it is what every body says.	91.60245033664374
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping lucases.	21.710262989464084
she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	32.138901867922456
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	21.690406473313512
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.	24.126150683437448
charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say.	56.8258041261715
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	19.971481631644764
i have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	32.37967087658616
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.	15.11356877158341
my feelings will not be repressed.	113.51977954276013
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."	15.490308984946136
engraved for no.	313.5051406605353
as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	10.002447885386777
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	19.56841166589227
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.	27.03043125598031
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings.	23.060342665792014
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	39.27516495874336
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!	31.796958455959707
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure," said he.	27.102518928347095
this however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	17.015550069651567
"if he wants our society, let him seek it.	37.99878302134585
how can it affect them?"	76.63841267396725
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	19.888650813805373
wickham passed all his youth there, you know."	57.138154216542766
well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	29.52003771247649
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	14.977556541712463
in three volumes.	232.8437795838202
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."	26.138894527039735
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family.	14.361197521005156
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	23.91881484379863
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.	17.01270587668237
no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	42.50866191081768
he was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	28.163682988272228
her power was sinking; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	19.58532309064083
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals.	20.963363125863975
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	12.335658302828042
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	13.77719161112695
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	31.73089573912125
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	21.31133436999206
she added, "by far too much.	59.77052037739714
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	18.404462857919246
mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	16.32034453869935
that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as mr bingley, was incomprehensible.	16.73701932089683
mary and kitty, thank heaven!	80.49456816733279
mr darcy may hug himself."	65.48467556176381
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!	32.6710405639589
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done!	22.81317500367431
i guessed as much."	132.6413777661731
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.	28.379944144945245
your sister i also watched.--her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--if you have not been mistaken here, i must have been in an error.	13.988789966974965
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	18.542209178830163
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	21.888645785232022
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	20.580479121115275
recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	22.79143524436741
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	12.49476617700948
but now it comes out."	71.61321054866451
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."	19.20318986184734
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"	31.14011705220719
gardiner."	421.04278027013885
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	24.767295099134767
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together."	18.484072363456402
you shall hear what she says."	80.98473353497083
for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	38.550422115360675
however, i recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well."	26.562126886369366
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	30.045912420083127
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	91.04012080193691
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	20.254878773733466
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	55.0765936121073
i am ashamed of you!	149.83262130453107
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.	19.210309789175618
it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	21.81185065881098
"no, she would go home.	95.7940723932213
if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	45.46876255929462
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you say that he was at rosings?"	24.888635911025474
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	17.95248059497403
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	16.668684567189544
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	16.762824336504348
"oh, lizzy!	161.81634192481593
if you are outside the united states, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg-tm work.	9.975887657830215
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge?"	29.172916766327425
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	21.251469689525628
were it known to the rest of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	29.62427825349546
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	32.15209495165063
we want none of them; do we?"	55.280540432119665
"but not before they went to brighton?"	68.05198506904189
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at pemberley.	12.787782584878673
i cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as i often see done."	24.490390956756457
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	25.156869968320834
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	77.89639742624352
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	18.63785336326947
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	22.129234047800896
"i cannot make him out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	15.957052389232835
well, how pleased i am!	134.80171439076426
what congratulations will then flow in!	81.39725648172139
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	38.33961173196144
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	26.539144095305506
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	21.80214760985434
where is your sash my dear?"	75.20373262497462
how rich and how great you will be!	73.59505938632311
cried jane.	486.69819616052865
"indeed you are mistaken.	137.54732144261348
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	29.7028775089631
but now it was all too natural.	93.3561254968452
i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.	41.46585060185645
"but how did he account for it?"	53.8310492611046
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy.	54.642977292939044
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	38.02498750932491
i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	41.24717230240796
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	16.3142158826753
not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things i know are all chance in this world.	31.71214515447971
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	31.201961537374668
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter.	16.192890613084536
had his character been known, this could not have happened.	50.591441334308705
elizabeth looked surprised.	283.8902050505892
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	30.275845021497346
come be quick, be quick!	89.91698472754797
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	16.335394765474454
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	21.822117277213614
mr collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	26.83583857448641
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.	14.156659889255598
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	14.561392322754543
not that i care about it, though.	91.65578712514049
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane.	50.04396333467075
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again."	17.938979556952635
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	82.00233121556032
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."	14.605584207840206
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.	29.036241064853147
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	37.28812786618705
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	29.14532009813257
he readily agreed to it.	124.20848857656057
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	18.274361546733584
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	24.901197898554223
mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	36.8914792074346
"all!--what, all five out at once?	42.957509858545
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	32.81722527654342
1.f.6.	77.29786367167914
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	32.11602891924668
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	30.683957738513485
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	13.685430508231892
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	19.49017747802177
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	15.989929560055879
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.	21.21516321348992
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	27.787596616363206
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!	27.700255855596403
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	20.657327633150135
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	16.737557511163114
bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever.	49.593271615431824
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	31.995596089886998
to mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	19.103362172453316
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	25.962983800824617
but i have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world."	15.47142743932751
from their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	46.483306166119924
as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	19.467597262337737
i see the imprudence of it.--oh!	54.25569032250369
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	43.863575073551836
i cannot understand it.	154.36321861670274
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs long has just been here, and she told me all about it."	24.608425437404055
he shall not be in love with me, if i can prevent it."	43.45389373443168
but, really, i know not what to say.	59.716545096763454
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	19.628156154590258
"how can you be smiling so, lizzy?"	44.71720964037534
i am quite well.	139.4455566296864
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."	21.63158204021185
and i think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	18.556948816646052

"oh!	271.02234991487614
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you must marry.	13.107515934081231
their table was superlatively stupid.	88.49165869327891
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	30.60498477120278
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	24.33735399616427
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.	24.199439697253194
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about.	31.846513447294765
an airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	34.99043615760793
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton.	23.991108754071256
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	30.55495254825761
"wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's."	26.145302810250133
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	20.479960005130597
"there is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	25.272822521321704
"you must not blame my aunt.	77.24746599233164
"nothing child, nothing.	130.79088268962747
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	16.021861158835762
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	17.499695700493067
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	13.713729290251257
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	21.822629301623433
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	14.70420857262335
"oh!	271.02234991487614
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	17.009242453565662
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."	21.37364355405217
mr collins then returned to elizabeth.	97.77050166167882
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	16.14725523072294
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	15.97899369790926
is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very ill."	15.936975912094725
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	43.325295275641665
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	28.42457328321114
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	13.703847018127364
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	14.040997888105547
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	18.630057656801768
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	29.605151204554296
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	16.21752106436291
promise me, therefore, to come to hunsford."	72.67620726195933
every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.	16.94421371813093
however, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."	21.231228536863103
his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	31.40107497770594
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	15.410374436813814
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire."	13.703196099837324
she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	23.320901755956143
but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."	19.795731106034182
he made no answer.	142.033008013556
we seem to have been designed for each other."	47.18807234848745

it is highly improper.	140.8515204739185
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i wish he had danced with eliza."	22.533854363527634
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope, though you have but a short lease."	28.461930552595692
pray, how violent was mr bingley's love?"	44.929061125821555
they saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	54.35385530828222
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	23.583842027462513
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."	40.00149117481522
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	14.277680781489256
she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	31.793335672570656
"good god!	238.40981847632884
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	19.980916716052064
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	49.19503627761697
mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.	18.536580339394206
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	18.336102695798573
and she was only sixteen last june.	63.77610762908902
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley.	39.58459691095634
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	48.14101855309257
to all the objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	32.51967074830329
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	82.13300199179555
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards miss king.	27.37893141056189
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	20.96582495713359
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	21.030060222230993
it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it.	19.755659926678657
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	91.9230713026146
i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."	41.74134115397143

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	100.69475984440234
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	44.09609033725998
well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	30.737679603038483

he looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley.	25.44334303417531
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"	17.78802312561007

mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	18.905937827650828
"she looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	30.689587818224066

the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	18.600150179451145
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	28.491794531770058
she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	20.72744810573646

in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	17.601125526804246
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	28.38539821268455
"but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be brought to reason.	24.128600682844638
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	21.857921861057925
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	31.934571258180643
"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her brother--"because he does not write with ease.	26.635489711773893

after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	17.6036187690352

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	15.656967098972492
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.	32.547173569962375
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	10.954767888182646

in the hall they parted.	116.94412701454668
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	17.88279771886631
elizabeth silently attended her.	168.29179175736357
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	22.451304257795933

* * * * * it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.	14.75577746680297
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	25.157074705600596
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	15.23261945475952
but papa is so disagreeable."	94.86458882368443
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present.	15.29157752322325
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	14.860801627973228
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.	24.972767859518676
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."	26.34942317427347
indeed he has no improper pride.	101.67583899540963
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	26.262956324084936
mr collins was eloquent in her praise.	73.93967563508782
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire."	31.669133886454535
she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	20.523735898917792
it would be dreadful!	173.04717787929835
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.	15.573998921620994
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	37.79452827876771
we now come to the point.	130.3238782798136
in confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	19.382850026787146
ten thousand a year!	150.11004306068023
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	21.01402913389833
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	14.44058878969597
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	26.4416039085068
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	32.48879637962374
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.	15.943454902755347
"it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	30.680822889983297
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster, the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described.	22.55957489275543
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.	19.325822289330578
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect.	33.6326030035653
when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	29.69852732453805
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	15.727641990790808
it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it."	43.066989866579064
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	28.446147338083733
their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	12.648437577832537
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	20.244631158540308
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.	26.894092201772125
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	36.27585286350645
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	13.72421930065573
came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	16.548063381020455
"oh!	271.02234991487614
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	17.36637286054288
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	21.39272708061954
it would have been strange if they had.	65.31426680430748
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not know."	25.99768948363844
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	15.938833171761742
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	14.2550357044097
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	20.26466251468442
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards."	15.838912464497556
1.e.3.	64.45994739749796
but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.	17.534721847467882
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	70.24858238038783
darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.	32.69029082341057
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	15.28661723143969
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	16.791766881470394
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	15.429241198249194
elizabeth made no answer.	129.21457372827552
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice?	14.078556168348829
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	21.064918738163133
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to say.	24.934375351657238
"i never heard any thing so abominable.	58.652565797999905
mr bennet made no answer.	94.15105199841092
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	22.662197518158102
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	21.53176047440405
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	47.794036571266524
what i have to say relates to poor lydia.	53.32615232176178
for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	22.618746209322758
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	27.394203521166293
very odd!--and you only the second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your younger sisters must be very young?"	18.512827312932536
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before they did.	21.025952923232573

she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."	12.540771817728436
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	54.57268399002708
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration.	46.59277099039851
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	22.323253917704683
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.	37.39334001616264
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	20.56284451865618
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from caroline.	32.99491873564168
how can mr bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	26.926365829138483
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	16.1517650974768
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	47.17468607394419
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty.	20.075042534364478
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	54.31504364733665
"not at all."	93.03659189743446
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	21.26849757018932
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	26.28661721233628

thursday was to be the wedding day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	16.60589192595945

"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence.	34.268991139377825

i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make me happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."	17.574684484388428
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	56.53169345263376
"i wish it may."	82.86904766175687
she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	15.330640607268057
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	46.272167763798386
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	29.771449972412658

your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."	26.691274348602256
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	16.08349649848513
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	16.45424219008477

it was unpardonable.	245.76474545027884
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said bingley.	37.74597782533617
said elizabeth, still addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	64.20032020683757
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	21.987474937055275
cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	52.95220864926455
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	19.55108271381234
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion."	23.79392348839726
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	22.58129378795273
when they repaired to the dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	22.20994691358874
but the case is this.	147.57011922160493
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do.	33.815304397657
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	15.828653188306914
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	20.909675150172156
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	40.04691107313154
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is impossible.	16.631403438353676
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in me."	28.84304069761546
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	16.35882084147433
but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	19.228411572456572

lady catherine rose also, and they turned back.	60.75609120293784
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	24.48044837255781
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects.	26.257624783029353
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."	21.78034520602576
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	76.8338915082387

his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	65.29483296197127
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	25.67447897168764

teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	54.42669081520166
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	18.54787193386603
it was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	19.212300717129683
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope my dinners are good enough for her.	17.769383297032785

bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	65.94189805086464
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."	20.385423515992503
my situation in life, my connections with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	14.635928270514308
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	39.94570260543131
"yes, yes, they must marry.	72.23895707239821
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.	20.748641055350326
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia.	26.38647851669018
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	46.66034188077532
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration.	31.93481269504368
mr collins!"-- "my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	26.627990885847463
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it be not so, let mr darcy contradict it.	14.21647238726468
she respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	16.582972433902853
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	38.98644297988359
mr bennet treated the matter differently.	88.44482144937443
in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	20.465338130779475

do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	24.136865764660648
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."	15.03788257547605

but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.	25.886891018073722
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	19.836353645118862

"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	37.3405035136919
so, do not put yourself to inconvenience."	54.83156553094523
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	22.671617192910656
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	17.82694930359893
when a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."	29.550938631930027
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	13.38053142490203
darcy made no answer.	147.09709391272796
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam.	31.360410898391507
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	16.831540116679236
i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	49.225935423082895
* * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	17.428987564770555
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	37.044802055042005
how i long to see her!	116.78216314124572
they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	13.212936925531118
"i do not get on at all.	55.31845748040481
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this.	46.39637415922661

thank god!	513.8414967399096

every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	23.525774225347888
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	17.039539101988897
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."	28.51020953170556
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	42.67489474374948
i can hardly write for laughing.	75.1466617475159
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	20.656700890312226
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	23.352094146828993

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	43.538188659929695
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	34.747040957815855
but my dear lydia, i don't at all like your going such a way off.	34.57990249005746
"but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	24.810247684330648
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	55.16366358762939
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.	12.569305559245167
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is too far off!	16.53049774575555
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained.	20.968536842507188
you have sense, and we all expect you to use it.	43.61869350882461
hang kitty!	569.1221600529941
i am not qualified to form one.	56.57064836829293
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him!	19.408359888037918
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.	49.34934521113167
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	36.81732392443642

"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."	29.20114651790754
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above.	36.16252083352499
he now wished it more than ever.	84.38196602028047
"of music!	236.4076179825862
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy."	18.73217447846706
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you.	21.682019979722167
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	17.655341393129735
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	48.98971187306712
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	35.17581189093297
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	29.217290859156783
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	25.506936031270154
but as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.	38.35700362666834
one ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	33.66641602813033
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	18.307116242433562
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "let me call your maid.	14.876489532475986
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	24.45953105909557
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued absence.	23.00870636412036
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips.	25.14766386701341
he danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	18.769512924261182
why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	39.4899792689786
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair."	15.827144951265876
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."	48.42371552439412
but i can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."	18.164125804237077
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	44.3329088606515
this was agreed to, and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	17.834327891709552
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	13.606453979847386
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be certain.	24.98047959580662
the first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.	12.284686892732548
i dearly love a laugh."	82.61528853250279
on mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.	16.958196443769737
that such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."	21.56008524613901
single, my dear, to be sure!	93.04585259618948
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	37.3308629171988
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	20.219634526223448

elizabeth now began to revive.	124.82254257971073
yes;--there is nothing in that.	75.39148675253485
have you had any flirting?	159.38408705740724
he owns it himself without disguise."	53.71805258457207
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	19.682616743576517
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	28.415212923287804
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."	21.16536748225167
mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	15.067707627198562
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life.	26.39384553180276
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	17.30092266399004
i shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	22.483185161575964
"eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds.	17.809392303600664
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	16.094646705627085
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	13.279815652023713
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can dance."	16.861673063829855
other schemes too came into her head.	72.51310132542778
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.	30.423276012809506
"you look pale.	158.3456785201258
mr darcy bowed.	236.77844814456677
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	21.99799392785581

"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	18.490809576456513

four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	23.13674276072454
what are you telling miss bennet?	101.25419496773011
the least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	23.52274897725939
but i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	37.44485355849365
at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	23.593448720336532
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	54.59301335051118
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more affection than she feels.	27.530307598509836
and his sisters are charming women.	79.42281254657011
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.	20.748829910449466
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	45.19258395497248
darcy mentioned his letter.	188.68274452739132
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	33.12950137608482
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	16.375123620306898
the visit was returned in due form.	54.14936562500969
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	96.95435563752213
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	20.917491075031844
it is almost past belief.	99.46815110874849
but now suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	14.009477282560608
the miss webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--do you draw?"	20.747604151288115
no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	26.651071486939802
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	25.54278818337176
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."	21.51662636506288
you had much better dance."	96.4117291434224
chapter vii.	412.12655134874456
"can you come to-morrow?"	84.08994292256851
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	60.429218267732224
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	71.95488807674062
it was only said, 'lately, george wickham, esq.	37.8693317218208
it will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."	19.82858517691766
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	18.58839981392508
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."	33.93758635742298
but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	19.486398014294725
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	46.632250738496545
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	70.12479621894272
secondly, that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	16.435247334041883
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	17.43143614337444
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	25.7079373711999
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked.	64.98516914449057
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	59.771407788119596
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	19.565074812281303
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and mrs hurst was observing their game.	31.753045578178085
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?"	25.30623413712807
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	52.42919188701345
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	29.862352763870014
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	76.52887518080989
another day i will do the same; i will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	18.5152475999685
he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; charlotte tried to console her.	19.35494060735401
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	20.720805075918822
of his former way of life, nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	33.6483965923359
mr bingley followed his advice.	94.2060524027529
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.	16.22400559197802
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	34.90084645169001
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	41.626961778853286
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	23.150611602331047
he added, that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and promised to write again very soon.	28.08017619726839
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern.	62.4643022736194
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	27.846248945277924
i know not what to think.	85.12933627870312
"i am trying to make it out."	50.26529526876457
"none at all.	166.9661331907981
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	32.06917627160403
she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	22.863324520126767
mr darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!	23.983776522851063
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."	41.215646101394945
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking.	35.65450935941266
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	68.65819144275484
but i know the foundation is unjust.	82.53356893434741
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	47.704871747584484
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	20.97789986644968
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."	18.87405197720508
"and they must marry!	156.56956770757543
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	22.174827001146827
indeed, eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."	34.63462760032128
does he know his real character?"	64.45232767776918
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	25.36950533340754
though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	48.04388636895131
she replied in the affirmative.	165.33779595093046
at night she opened her heart to jane.	64.60908735360832
what a fine thing for our girls!"	60.23475342529334
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	34.93624017278773
but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	37.4810216065904
i know no harm of her."	67.04820498610404
"ah!	411.51459383306917
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and i know i appeared distressed.	18.111549396423783
if an individual project gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges.	10.554434552224583
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	19.971232290470077
it is just as he chooses.	106.97013289395568
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.	21.73009292318145
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	19.896068838790924
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	36.88943742695737
all field sports were over.	100.29014091703635
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's looks and behaviour.	18.12548470321461
"and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.	26.57001840325026
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	18.404312790092625
compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.	60.46233663514224
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	44.611630169102305
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	54.62021287668241
but our visitor was very obstinate.	94.79292916799646
he arranges the business just as he pleases."	51.49472791019388
they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.	38.47619521615461
well, well, i only hope it will last.	65.38980530748837
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	37.492404450740786
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	23.451552059704824
"gracechurch-street, monday, august 2.	51.941101474845475
when she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	17.07031929174026
it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you.	29.36554928394393
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	23.49363375568845
"yes, she did."	100.50554524962678
"and what is your success?"	73.37349409593618
i owe all that i know of it, to another, not to you."	54.14053749183413
it was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	39.7791550220418
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	13.282026065592841
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed.	29.780860720904965
and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."	14.321702950281958
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine about this report?	43.59158696781267
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, i dare say."	35.74643229323435
"gracechurch-street, sept.	137.23023648323206
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	31.14214658146816
it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	31.520810512800285
"beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	22.750521602471814
she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	18.407929478140172
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say nothing of that.	18.259590873444857
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	79.05309831457572
no, no--i feel he may defy us there.	44.51069433804266
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	40.90860689862597
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	21.467644548448817
"edw.	493.52858076367403
at present i will say nothing about it."	56.041867968345
"my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	33.545183255880154
i shall see her in january.	99.1182567918548
it is mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	17.687307592348265
but you have chosen your fault well.--i really cannot laugh at it.	29.6695641709369
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr darcy had much better finish his letter."	22.418142419106044
a small sum could not do all this."	65.5251851443219
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	15.819351592958638
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the subject.	30.347692934983545
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	32.5256574115914
said charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	75.33830181364303
a house in town!	223.2145867457746
there was no help for it however.	88.11080053757127
and a special licence.	119.28838855884561
lord bless me!	241.79941636195736
she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	33.06338032933413
"and pray may i ask?"	57.98803304973187
his pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	22.939098256085508
chapter vi.	440.93963481431535
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	21.967363448474533
will you tell me how long you have loved him?"	46.177241055972914
she wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	36.70229023316922
she smiled, but made no answer.	93.15632480502539
i should infinitely prefer a book."	58.54707476826162
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	22.74136410428855
unless a copyright notice is included.	72.96901024846966
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	31.953858763495923
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel.	18.810208749136653
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	20.681151817404423
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	37.632869110769654
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	14.66813727147029
it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	20.875504850807953
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	17.896981121631892
"and your defect is a propensity to hate every body."	30.798895399792674
"and you saw him frequently?"	79.02108628178341
all was joy and kindness.	98.40426603479374
"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."	17.899337707504827
when denny, and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	34.628386615919155
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	35.73461614612072
what shall we do with him?	150.86840472786272
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	25.77299850598014
by nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at st james's had made him courteous.	16.931037948564
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.	9.262979871095391
well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss!	45.46805735617963
you are not going to be missish, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	29.74788596347061
"no governess!	247.68237812091851
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	53.00143432659003
she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	26.1415950241678
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	31.21207235881469
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	15.9323862686302
chapter xii.	412.12655134874456
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	77.21281508084103
she is quite a little creature.	121.64836713767893
it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	21.517787503555493
"good heaven!	217.35499418099678
risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."	17.384569859103514
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	28.459787729818846
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.	28.231780786808894
after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	17.173790127054026
if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."	25.45725693593007
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.	17.80582003222878
gardiner."	421.04278027013885
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	55.40906098010029
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	24.405948815005747
mrs bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	18.500800242562292
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to mr darcy.	20.316447555189328
oh!	714.3130208232782
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	24.263119561061615
lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	28.155929961051385
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."	25.452348082955922
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"	41.53578959581189
"they will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	17.77075565740565
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	40.6170059303828
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	53.4927619886922
elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.	13.61864465173794
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	18.56369220269988
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	28.549885999095434
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	51.53729373616457

"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."	17.45981285473301
the recollection of what i then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	24.85808347599863

"oh, jane, take care."	65.58517712966062
after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	16.501177892420273
no, never.	288.89942747660484
you know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	20.92350305032851
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	15.153046961087238
"good heaven!	217.35499418099678
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "oh, papa, what news?	16.044197981944073
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	23.68669610046388
i wish you had been there.	101.70946491437438
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	19.070654042193503
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	21.49560899553467
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	53.79883688945465
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	15.84303048853014
one came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	56.55012879900927
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit.	26.23122077595031
with his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	15.664732158495186
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.	15.979173504492174
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	29.691232564313925
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.	22.402512664964963
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	18.860250505398366
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	15.63926528162955
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.	32.21934556678686
but, alas!	196.02373184309118
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	16.81971602263608
what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening.	17.165785130370573
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?"	36.60473128606443
mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	38.93910224430349
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	27.97328363868684
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	47.41796223926877
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	12.940627724842418
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite."	56.52296960724077
and mrs forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	25.441060215044526
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	28.263842089941985
but i knew i should persuade you at last.	67.74062302063712
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	12.753829860139414
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	15.349918115547792
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.	19.81652365782547
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	20.804399384260904
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	74.90633580767492
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	21.30393079611196
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"oh!	24.57876856478118
i must speak to hill, this moment."	56.78067792448079
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	22.937857236601314
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	21.48256882414762
"oh!	271.02234991487614
he could even listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james's, with very decent composure.	13.129435950729928
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	23.869028545618246
you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	34.894868144779146
she finds miss pope a treasure.	56.40708757665002
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	15.06403046548235
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	23.301287025705193
you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."	22.412551210098158

he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away.	32.17373089851522
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"	20.23110676989587
he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	25.920847562146445
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	15.150065992242832
let me hear from you very soon.	71.73625803599342

she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	31.583968765426718
"no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."	25.5717398228308
soon after you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were.	27.627253148468558
how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	26.9271076481375
she could think only of her letter.	98.540290423327
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	26.31282931926043
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	51.41711162150264
her ladyship was highly incensed.	99.76939312282477
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	31.524415091563146
yet, indeed, i am in earnest.	83.78305977959732
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	17.449360096301866
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	25.06768862866927
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.	33.9454883987533
on saturday he came again.	119.91711500811958
it was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	33.76243477762664
her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	45.611624729843584
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	41.620432972883755
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	39.08190838859058
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	40.42004901433424
"oh!	271.02234991487614
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	17.901208389729206
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	42.70733557404493
what hours of transport we shall spend!	73.10248112323603
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet."	46.323644854939836

his pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure."	15.267118123952883
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	30.14061157546133
you must not disappoint your father."	63.1907599258635
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	28.33432936202191
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	38.174188202352106
"and so was i."	86.04007731763048
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	24.69548036605751
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	16.62012955579467
but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	19.185219160117473
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	22.501287260995433
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	15.772640175319301
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."	28.307519959391318

i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	17.320061580248314
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	27.522178774249426
pray do not talk of that odious man.	84.63744908297222
i am sick of them all.	89.53442182765357
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	56.310203407719754
i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother.	44.67231124669617
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"	44.867196798804976

my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."	28.15089557702338
there can be no love in all this.	68.89087092819834

it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them both----" "then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	22.50466802275413
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."	29.898136839993622
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."	24.276232009146227
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	18.790151458542308
"good gracious!	195.91039972965092
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her.	14.72817647823081
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."	28.90135835142433
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	42.375054025336624
it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.	18.707003021757867
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	22.027077015764398

this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	14.301576328697415

not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did mrs bennet give up the point.	32.16680424560214
while she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	15.210432464260547

they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.	13.933140833641424
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make their marriage at all more probable?	21.186522883182814
i will take care of myself, and of mr wickham too.	52.16544942714646
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	25.202752601339782
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	22.00327439176837
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	26.639533097711947
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.	13.761743195400218
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	20.715836831688954
they can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."	27.0578408950663
"what should not you mind?"	77.38195512436808
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	12.90840012646649
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	17.8814436734053
i am prodigiously proud of him.	72.24405878511091
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	35.96374678628857
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	34.42676436402583
he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."	32.626413294448724
perhaps there was some truth in this; though i doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event.	26.344432452117278
i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	36.040075163900475
"i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said darcy.	27.135015647421245
"from mr collins!	215.4644950898602
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	13.490179651126178
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	16.411840170337832
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley.	23.34909285716153
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	21.268061150278296
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	20.835709776881437
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	17.61189473895193
where shall you change horses?--oh!	48.662069135644074
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great books, and make extracts."	25.280959561162437
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	21.03251591303806

mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	26.933675416182822

"that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance.	24.82063099897319
but, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."	24.107989651559087
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly.	51.360949630307985
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property."	27.937831759407835
and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son?	24.715390870055604
"dear lizzy!"	186.21999665633237
you may ask questions, which i shall not choose to answer."	38.70375953922042
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	18.129730865820417
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	46.27378124225366
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	19.903987910745855
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	17.841040250592346
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	26.53870997202656
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	32.25456062737975
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy, she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	14.230307161572398
"i have, sir."	76.809962026641
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	25.20887864843119
"what, none of you?"	79.73689786312578
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham.	34.23312808641415
they are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	22.49338648610121
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	16.846752337858078
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."	18.671799526388842
"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	36.79830698558186
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	71.64204877554057
"i am not one and twenty."	50.04112219565492
i am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	51.684475587453875
she was overpowered by shame and vexation.	52.99277641790785
as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth."	15.832104293107616
"you have said quite enough, madam.	70.76918743305067
it cannot be.	279.37485899929277
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	49.37497349967107
in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	18.93294313266485
the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!	36.33296274928148
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham, and rejoiced in it.	32.0517527051844
we have heard nothing from town."	76.25948028966198
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	21.20880040508872
"upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield.	25.265567676893365
"oh!"	168.74486172860762
i did not expect such a compliment."	72.32783673992633
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."	17.55320011698184
elizabeth replied that it was.	158.97785677602948
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time.	70.1628727282363
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	20.891669904237197
lydia came to us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	50.18074708399829
"how good it was in you, my dear mr bennet!	57.82255098164835
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.	16.862311497104752
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	19.13013038169263
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	65.29616583049415
i did not know before, that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony.	33.93317285159819
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	18.831964078803257
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	21.474900940065666
the comfort to her, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	37.28259208852129
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that i am not to be trifled with.	26.159664824828333
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton.	11.665973902459507
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	23.096297693235154
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	21.627738856399226
cried elizabeth.	401.65552359617834
but we are all liable to error.	68.36034766810748
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	17.909553286790366
but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	14.118995273190643
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	21.583775343633395
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	13.74583924908222
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	50.62730476990282
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	20.93825993569849
i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from you.	30.299623652833418
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	30.474385815437866
mr darcy!--and so it does i vow.	42.062734610441254
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."	25.71607153827064
chapter ix.	440.93963481431535
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	22.50016485225318
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	15.585525156360482
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	12.786820721324732
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?"	32.21355727700364
at least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."	34.16073810620594
haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	50.6306917593132
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	20.507483140014
howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.	23.015307484408012
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	20.085418791047204
if you are a good girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of them."	28.09081903534185
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, "do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	20.328086762414472
only look at her.	207.24040743174547
in spite of having been at st james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	13.737800701461335
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	11.511458102317214
but, lizzy!	257.3404749536418
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	18.997050353392634
dear lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	57.975561024771004
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	23.585616336872206
the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	26.5551837656893
i cannot think so very ill of wickham.	69.66114974280353
but in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	38.50314486317514
did you see him while you were at lambton?	71.99298557066817
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede.	41.24782141272832
i am sure you must feel it so."	55.05614207840919
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror.	25.179990115219457
oh, sister!	292.45769533043995
it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	14.150400013934718
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	47.17953699735186
cried he, turning towards her.	112.23372196446114
see paragraph 1.e below.	84.84356415590666
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	34.424000040394056
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	20.18453416491688
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate.	26.831418919353226
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	37.69420309211905
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	27.893100615928184
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	24.37231876934244
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."	19.980497702635418
"dear sir, "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	36.06275624130989
how odious i should think them!"	79.86404320906964
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	21.1838696008223
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	21.787313846210036
you know him too well to doubt the rest.	56.900860630767404
it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire.	14.976755344180505
at length, she spoke again.	110.36746582551723
what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"	40.53398596858494
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.	14.653618351641539
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	41.06826394411202
"i am sure there is not on his.	66.29851790149269
elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.	40.43364897852846
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	20.478473173690407
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point.	49.327880696547034
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.	19.152282240758787
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time.	20.1208202836878
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	19.84618875227092
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.	24.098220430310267
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know."	25.316220139098792
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	62.464055978962165
mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding.	34.300523434449865
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	18.840188109541323
i have not been accustomed to such language as this.	40.12165655329416
"complied with!	281.1469851849782
one day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	25.128676969199624
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	26.991660609372087
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	23.029470305343015
i quite forgot!	251.30129782197443
we neither of us perform to strangers."	52.817398685126896
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	38.38669575526364
mr collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.	13.518677100156609
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.	27.10755656688755
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.	21.932248521515945
if you'll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight.	20.65680930646495
"your's, &c."	45.07104629470212
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	20.766972348799168
"and my mother--how is she?	73.40805022510034
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	30.9812500826231
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	10.362431627006291
she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	16.117881145093833
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	14.107726188757432
but it was not to be.	106.77557120314259
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	19.734063344285037
people did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true.	25.492019029954516
cried lydia.	553.2120099767872
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	15.551238725418408
but that is one great difference between us.	58.36414973095136
"you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	19.549853083778792
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for us.	27.679987623959374
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	15.702805006879771
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	18.799017133116426
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's."	18.388871087380604
it was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.	41.13017941958963
well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone.	22.240616020998697
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.	27.20460126391747
"i know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder.	35.090440083464344
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	12.92712477143556
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	50.01371913357219
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	22.97333064825114
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	36.767335681460104
"from the former.	224.39505853376698
but my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of, that i may have it to-morrow."	24.978805090867112
i promised them so faithfully!	98.12839017493957
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	17.679981002700476
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	40.95477452510927
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain?	29.011383199399205
my father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	65.12872759020232
who should suffer but myself?	114.7698159734087
mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	17.03204483343054
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	55.57878094537464
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.	12.830057997334535
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	71.68112378702507
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr hurst had a house.	16.430523811203383
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	22.488993509344198
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?	42.79698927332683
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	36.61590667339791
your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	27.820459264650932
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.	28.674307583444754
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	47.779398540501
your daughter elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land."	16.161456437885935
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.	30.39329824400597
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	26.930106301042166
"the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	33.167774814772194
i will leave him to himself."	85.65294640815235
lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."	19.132371728678674
she cried.	413.9657554020985
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	41.23947540755643
not handsome enough to dance with!	106.37154945096047
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."	38.47363248439818
"indeed i could not.	137.1338869102418
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	22.949389343226244
let us hope for better things.	69.37209077087392
what do i not owe you!	69.6005525297113
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time."	21.511599966166063
"the party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	34.09887075397375
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	27.441205051874462
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	14.701815590156118
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets (example: m^{rs}).	11.08164150528699
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	38.00586722857547
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	31.21207235881469
my mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she says.	27.104898903230694
"certainly not; at first.	112.24569761490592
she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids.	18.387441863741206
yes.	1086.8000246886304
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs bennet, alarmed.	43.56276843253262
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	52.084224186293696
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	44.85770199399837
i must beg to return to the house."	58.17032412815263
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable house.	36.15159657760465
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."	34.715258042063745
all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the london road.	30.554890843892657
on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	15.39997831616111
through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	18.556806683535385
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater beauty.	32.82370192579195
i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however, and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	15.317713667723162
mrs hurst thought the same, and added, "she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.	33.69514738780087
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	27.2465606217175
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	54.137308653143165
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."	30.76184075190538
the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	15.233773334601818
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	18.188878440342414
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	41.761326050656756
"oh!	271.02234991487614
but he is an ugly fellow!	95.96424034498884
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.	19.2658303334378
"where is your sister?"	101.83073605166413
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	61.975062121215345
my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	18.315017923553313
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."	17.558513290153485
the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.	23.45495110697318
"no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."	19.20366338945872
she repeated.	548.3177566407066
but she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	10.384005816640066
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	15.196954778177936
let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner.	17.549133294264443
she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	36.51454196762247
and what can he have to say?"	62.59064299937226
"and i certainly never shall give it.	59.92382455249232
"if it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	16.668213060550787
it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	17.655865388571012
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	20.3384024959544
"probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses.	38.47882121577486
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	24.627255282961826
by this time she is actually with them!	83.29808081589339
having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	14.703853909268297
she studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	27.56392161791369
when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	42.72085230784382
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	20.051275659052642
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.	39.35742259118857
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	26.322307908967524
"oh, yes!	123.40466468734213
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	47.369402222036946
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	23.69084172181094
at our time of life, it is not so pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.	22.562888695107937
hear me in silence.	229.64006414134948
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	17.074016895162117
"such as vanity and pride."	61.307236377512965
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	43.72976592001068
"if you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	32.49921786356137
but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years.	14.989360401293048
had the late mr darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	18.28159222849462
"no, indeed.	178.29790614355556
"and they are really to be married!"	75.35939720848366
"oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.	33.34038750163365
i thought we never should have got into the coach.	54.669619936366736
mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	19.84827297871612
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	33.048602946622694
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked up.	38.464969927066534
he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.	17.2831265966791
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "well, jane, who is it from?	24.79902615588548
he was angry.	276.9870432358265
miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	18.828554154634723
"what could become of mr bingley and jane!"	54.02502496003182
she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	54.51093739079023
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	56.71580834162024
"money!	530.2500711498409
had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	17.997840034387913
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	28.760749150918986
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	21.83328766909597
i do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body better looking.	24.03846032569793
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	58.50619195649388
at length the parsonage was discernible.	72.44951891988192
this is your final resolve!	102.42048845369362
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i am excessively attentive to all those things.	16.07992932862043
as for jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	20.497679184905866
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	32.126422573039385
how i wanted you!"	106.06065162165315
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it."	47.328651575327385
mr wickham began the subject himself.	105.8262066725886
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	13.268698798281267
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.	28.475450930630622
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes."	20.32241133709101
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should."	37.007593989738616
she declared her resolution.	173.73016913895296
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, "mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	17.64815236670487
had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	18.32328644187428
she shook her head.	152.72728760961496
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	17.598292931168316
she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	12.723430300261327
i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	31.76716169652522
let me do it without farther loss of time.	52.34057664430022
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i do remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	19.10904770070572
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	49.23560362416339
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	13.196897023763547
i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	36.240520206518575
"it is well.	170.47851814541792
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."	24.438106387242822
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves?	37.005562225734046
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	15.344426707649117
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."	23.402491509185623
but mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.	18.910470518584223
there he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.	60.54288054461044
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	18.191251436128383
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	17.745282646867448

he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there.	18.097254275481436
jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	20.442125114536353
"yes, almost every day."	70.43358757759242
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"	18.02553483841292
i came to try you.	134.6275276000063
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.	17.438010301951596
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long.	40.04782244687155
has she any family?"	94.32685180393405
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."	21.023095423739413
it is impossible for me to be impartial.	76.5354180017816
observed mrs bennet.	333.41239741480985
the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	36.098474628565526
her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	18.13322455371241
that is the place to get husbands.	91.11536981393189
oh!	714.3130208232782
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."	18.82841956643934
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	21.090879400408372
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.	19.45458592922827
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	33.28009624681447
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	15.45087356526049
but however he did not.	127.88343246517718
as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	38.48275658803839
he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."	20.914487798775063
mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	17.09892743127468
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	18.24768707465104
do you often dance at st james's?"	37.1612663503961
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	25.20817341182326
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	43.79844215266394
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	14.380259612572969
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.	29.005345848136663
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	38.698219525391025
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?"	36.80654426241095
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	21.6786278442666
mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last.' she did indeed.	38.844630797241145
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	26.977377651182906
"that is very strange.	117.29797844195441
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	30.454512621846565
this room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	26.18178936953035
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	45.95406141399046
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	24.838586050668912
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."	32.09741025480046
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford.	115.2174616534187
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	13.73106776856131
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you.	19.175253403537045
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	12.53685712732678
but at least it shews, that she was serious in the object of her journey.	43.5128138116437
mr wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return.	18.257743771658024
the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have.	16.160092429962155
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	16.27416300278655
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."	26.40450309714372
if i was to go through the world, i could not meet with a better.	52.15748094356834
"yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing.	50.82349120862716
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	36.125201024428314
in that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	24.094203177644978
she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	16.861350243085333
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	21.815813486755843
i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character."	25.896537782185042
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	13.949539794808707
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.	18.348462182463432
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	28.08017975196682
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well."	37.050005144500176
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	40.814575339658425
"do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?	29.346366804369868
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	20.929527826407966
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	29.22786501420335
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	24.61544578920604
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	21.691443185720306
it will pass away soon enough."	66.09389670452435
"what would she have said?--how would she have behaved?"	28.85455325507699
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	12.088885080222601
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	21.69094299236608
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	50.637113594141766
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	15.60028919042715
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.	29.272029477670447
she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	22.259145080183593
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."	18.418922954437495
he drew a chair near her.	76.67618814305621
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	26.829209131806337
and what sort of young lady is she?	63.784366965327564
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	15.199073690566324
do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	29.070073252130225
for what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"	26.747709203081666
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature.	35.748763435394814
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	13.440427070497522
"i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	24.55407753019189
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	28.49481300104248
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."	20.06286914328262
i must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	43.03886839438681
it was to this effect: "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.	12.890677453793563
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	20.04645418128582
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	13.855371550362296
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself.	34.68604401033402
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	19.71943182089558
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	24.539926351254522
they were in ---- street.	70.89910922952907
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.	18.605874983663362
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	47.96722340861949
in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.	30.546286128339542
he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	28.081223343931395
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	13.98837212380292
"no, my dear; i think not.	67.5105368855228
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge.	18.222517585716272
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--i shall not be able to keep you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.	13.40390099729736
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	16.027082075142793
her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	32.48677664084151
it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	31.54549443522073
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	19.595915155588337
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	40.63599723320888
they came.	546.2057718258534
"yours, &c."	62.32468477929475
very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	18.479522297044934
those who do not complain are never pitied."	51.52556328671899
a low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	27.166634718264103
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	55.275970456759154
why does she not come in?"	81.36401445295996
we have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	13.979077776552918
lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy.	16.78189983549192
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."	25.48728442913923
how i laughed!	258.5592229223484
he is gone to my father already.	97.75646996361064
chapter iv.	440.93963481431535
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	60.04321184997705
such a disappointment!	265.48625142041107
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	69.49807411232914
have not you always hated him?"	64.8600120778802
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	24.52065742063118
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	40.20489833787852
she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	20.020340904981925
oh!	714.3130208232782
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	19.755284738093106
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."	27.15633191678727
"and have you answered the letter?"	66.8763902173399
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	22.395439391534516
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	13.672584688366056
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	33.05975257790503
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	22.230176868061893
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon.	69.73583129675374
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	26.07348622960375
i send no compliments to your mother.	74.85001426357125
everything wore a happier aspect.	91.42425633558726
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	27.01159208978904
if he had another motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him.	37.12545755632455
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged.	15.354426736911142
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	22.190851100094303
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	44.31169112699484
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh.	22.300620875623743
on both sides it was only assertion.	82.93879674917079
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	14.681528165015571
do not let us quarrel about the past.	67.46676330876532
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	16.22764047666405
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	14.100140579069713
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	15.988005444982798
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	16.863212905784316
mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	22.603852485355024
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	13.140393219414321
what say you, mary?	198.78668927527355
"oh!	271.02234991487614
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	14.36172812992941
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	26.186086503625667
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.	20.937424475463956
she liked him too little to care for his approbation.	54.55850300544819
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr bingley."	24.797245037470315
"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.	24.311157602797792
oh, lord!	213.74812874062007
i know your disposition, lizzy.	92.93876617022248
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1.	12.295050323689942
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better.	20.086648685554792
she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	20.445906116826276
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	19.253057326914902
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	14.366008889988697
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	29.557521338160658
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	26.250046339070764
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	60.36545537995111
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	74.28126112494259
you will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	29.174772932562597
w.	1205.3165081967588
dear me!	544.4101222697598
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	29.105372927661822
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	18.727767314307965
chapter ix.	440.93963481431535
i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy.	21.699808047025
this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	23.402645471370096
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	16.224587697417274
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that i should be looked at.	41.424648631438515
"how can you talk so?"--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate."	18.302645175857748
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	23.899393274730205
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"	20.7370569865076
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	32.53608992513775
though lydia's short letter to mrs f.	64.24304190678295
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	22.159974640310956
let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	15.878199557516266
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out."	20.99177579534721
but these things happen so often!	86.91365073220548
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	11.339304109003134
he was on one side of her mother.	79.50518042995665
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?	40.75552891597434
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	33.41165314219739
chapter xiii.	440.93963481431535
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	43.08301919557281
must it be so?"	145.63691884654165
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	77.85589293815282
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	22.114139721186437
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	29.419540667971546
not that i am afraid of myself, but i dread other people's remarks."	31.599495977820073
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	17.562696818910254
chapter xv.	412.12655134874456
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	23.113246316179932
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel fitzwilliam.	32.64494065720008
what am i to do?"	94.62876506482205

when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	26.556472801233287
after this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	45.62167761305149
my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you write for me.	21.12166110210235
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	42.075819130534285
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	14.575755477872828
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	54.94463024001278
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."	24.330449706701906
"what can be the meaning of this!"	66.99027372952304
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	15.656069130152138
"yes," thought elizabeth, "that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	28.5978844772497
"mr darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	22.244340083790117
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	16.45475869245235

"i have heard from authority, which i thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	23.63045118628483
be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.	16.8474055184725

"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said elizabeth.	26.43135987979429
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.	16.43757079648013
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	65.71871390002022
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, "i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	24.17328845558051
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.	27.524075797545756

well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley.--but--good lord!	24.426141746507902
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	17.870040479178282
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party.	35.65564055740727
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	14.105215081027412

instead of viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	16.728166381882943
"a man who had felt less, might."	50.06541528753269
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	17.341541388051127
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	19.284801526933578

"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said elizabeth.	28.463192475634138
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do."	18.52275762823293
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	12.05961063275145

to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough.	39.169428529554324
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.	18.929034202636192
i quite detest the man."	80.93580913357134
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	15.278112417390732
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master.	20.839948711271273
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	33.35403550622388
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	65.92962552171831
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	58.62700798132853
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	19.149537201757827

she was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	20.42911369827087

mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	18.81663611016165
they were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	42.7405368579594
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	13.545031194714932
what a good joke it will be!	90.93379361962711
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	15.612418422577786
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	17.843026664696378
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	11.251170542627264
she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	14.17604958388653

you see on what a footing we are.	70.91123917943962
you give me fresh life and vigour.	56.73765019520639
you tear them to pieces."	89.48480220246053
elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley.	15.035348681556382
it seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	14.251602187364657
well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."	23.235751835272037
and so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?	46.21652922980816

and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."	20.595204492159652
it was really a very handsome thought.	81.51498817255245
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	39.60677391902512
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	18.381739400100045
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen pemberley."	26.629942995933252
yes, there was something in that; i told you so from the first, you may remember."	37.28681703021098
how much you must have gone through!"	70.41224624419988
"you shall have it in few words.	76.53099471182946
"no, nothing at all."	74.43366231321589
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	41.47155024436623
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	73.91291045889518
cried elizabeth.	401.65552359617834
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	51.00598533607265
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley.	56.892925503759535
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.	23.03396427753174
but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."	21.799235596783042
the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy.	27.86176818996614
"you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	37.45686427572239
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	35.91392400711001
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	25.076045302500013
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	61.08572810427774
in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	12.775490642321738
you must not suspect me.	103.48357126120068

mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--mr bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	13.703614225335201

my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	35.27335254093338
international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states.	14.852619035060936
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	22.869181553513734
between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.	36.2337909710578
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	23.712034765587333
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better.	42.77367894866917
1813.	696.3864706516476
his reception however was of the most flattering kind.	66.46927972536908
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."	39.19060989956668
i thought i should have broke my heart."	48.849539103002044
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	21.325988701066006
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	15.535809217753716
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."	16.09377213265249
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	16.26646527846383
my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself.	25.55280856095599
you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	26.13751551743121
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	21.941575437189414
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	40.68875798410193
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	18.431071669357557
how is half such a sum to be repaid?"	56.69686743500536
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	14.297279552857832
it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	26.227676546809835
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	22.254871935832696
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	27.83510105034638
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	15.346466290385282
with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	21.104654481895704
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.	18.474022604757636
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	97.63857939768577
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	22.4976568540479
i mend pens remarkably well."	69.80994369937726
"oh, lord!	120.78335919449526
"what is there of good to be expected?"	55.173826017511516
her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	27.6991398434614
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	61.62919970859096
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	18.952292576138827
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.	18.868731194665994
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	27.395961150671987
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	13.648860925667174
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	18.49256665243843
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	21.870612895749836
a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	31.922386693788237
but who was your mother?	168.9898895580017
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	38.73060664019955
mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	15.23550603557825
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself.	29.878171484582285
oh!	714.3130208232782
"oh, lord!	120.78335919449526
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me.	26.97316523934315
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	15.11664149765637
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	65.46363647963221
- you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm license.	10.441631958576592
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any better."	23.23496841839367
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention.	19.846202016413
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	13.562274394182573
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	28.468739917279564
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	24.08387061072807
besides, there was truth in his looks."	70.28289426351876
he had to be sure done much.	81.35072018293442
"i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk to oakham mount this morning.	23.572619292268804
her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	32.247121569216496
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	38.86248873002087
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	26.168008910566716
"oh, no!"	120.76456516075169
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	16.09135008589742
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	43.523313666547
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	18.55854157378195
said mr gardiner.	322.3121119849392
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	36.102798647908536
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	33.015230562048906
i am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	26.859244297422883
"something very much to the purpose of course.	76.71989462571447
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	16.802597770353234
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	23.53713554110382
they will have nothing else to do."	71.7442298088712
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	22.54517347898807
it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	32.64661167270378
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	43.29174500446235
it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."	16.124897516965518
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	38.7436916960344
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	17.208887539566888
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard.	18.590561540519076
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance.	12.880669744237201
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at pemberley.	28.056827377258312
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	29.241607698358436
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.	16.95342820616746
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	32.89204343253426
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	48.230136348249154
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	46.93845394784979
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	15.414503697429875
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	13.416123311812115
"i can easily believe it.	87.93826266635527
1.e.4.	64.45994739749796
1.f.	181.8229687533566
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	28.664509094933784
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	13.921072424003274
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	18.852813887507516
but her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	33.62976562627651
but i have other provocations.	112.08027841071008
and so did mrs forster.	128.11624258778156
she shall hear my opinion."	91.15272772323463
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	59.45380119517507
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	36.394208703660574
"you are quite right.	108.19389257877728
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.	26.16177089985377
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	18.206500828253965
"you can now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	38.19884345362581
does she live near you, sir?"	57.502993422400976
i was sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	22.84404809581557
"already arisen!"	149.20516067262133
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."	14.22391084839657
"my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	14.726638390787315
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	31.299742370013217
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	29.367237245681768
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	35.51057156592761
my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	14.692458761108108
chapter xi.	412.12655134874456
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	16.020062845460988
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	75.82202432591866
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance.	19.80380207978851
i am sure my sisters must all envy me.	34.90535089597096
he was full of joy and attention.	64.68944809229393
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	49.08486979504569
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	32.86226217723109
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	14.525288723406588
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	59.261660298958105
but it is of small importance."	65.99707076519945
and do you really love him quite well enough?	60.39591597464494
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	73.22463329688645
cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."	18.102328962048794
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	20.98825752406232
they were natural and just.	117.13469335383544
allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."	14.823945192321343
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	49.27278480743764
but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	22.112611174629148
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	34.041393988156116
since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been his design.	23.816103469171
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.	15.35134140041688
he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."	43.94411679708873
my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	29.220033487548246
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	29.1844999156409
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings.	17.757487192993484
her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	32.097672743526815
her father lifted up his eyes.	79.96101953640175
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, "lizzy, i never gave you an account of my wedding, i believe.	24.682767099086465
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	20.60402631324318
sir william only smiled.	148.14879963480792
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty.	26.917153879603678
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	67.36940509707419
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	17.737812920037637
had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"	15.174031610777352
chapter iii.	412.1199797521609
you are a gentleman's daughter.	81.92009902881404
there was one part especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again.	25.764206411442704
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together.	44.50298625939069
lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia.	23.53763754979614
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	30.96552985373413
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	20.705625824694184
is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?	33.565919423054744
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"it will be her turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	37.9141144525669
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	28.63309052238957
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	26.007299869052524
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.	16.743640735337788
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."	13.09769339085074
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet.	16.276874368867748
we can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	18.385613076902573
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.	38.928636351429944
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent.	21.13870147053583
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	18.88902993493893
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be angry."	29.377534761792106
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	22.086824196939492
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	40.487686535914406
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	13.435916483754488
"i am sorry it went off.	52.879797937641804
their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	20.429295088511754
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield.	16.899780521642757
its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	23.998918817324178
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, i am determined.	26.269661276975658
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord, how tired i am!"	14.197257979300593
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too much.	47.5854219924066
"but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."	20.154650293131425
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant.	29.353265440627975
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	37.43071062908282
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	28.54763861741578
i was ready to die of laughter.	58.85635967797944
"and do you really know all this?"	54.70523344896083
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "oh!	24.82202121677654
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn.	20.108673861027217
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	21.109730327813434
"what is his name?"	98.34080596072995
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	15.578042723998248
but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?"	30.212141087194436
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet mr darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	11.860085500150252
"if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	14.584281070939651
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	23.99039066532944
allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, (glancing at her sister and bingley,) shall take place.	15.899321778002852
from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him.	29.257945741638768
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.	14.418407012734681
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	62.412531905321615
you have liked many a stupider person."	46.202027398187994
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	18.405737280768534
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	29.46598343234352
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	39.44871522608107
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	26.630483041703396
much as i abominate writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any consideration.	29.992516108017856
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	11.430387477515609
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	31.957651246163035
chapter v.	440.93963481431535
it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	23.80257177719672
but i make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	39.75348059764675
find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.' allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	17.586709131911153
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.	20.158888997372546
you mentioned two instances.	156.2054921063665
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	62.29085656988301
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!	25.318095645976598
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."	15.018868811967748
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	43.437851249462845
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	14.624379996862872
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	33.07766288291882
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!	46.40552494175717
that abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	20.853978062690167
he never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too.	12.817970443767482
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	19.070037865404018
"i had much rather go in the coach."	51.00033530103707
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	20.43876654951397
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	17.03681653512837
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.	21.30492632934597
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	67.36176349609764
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	24.895753127000514
his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	18.13403289911904
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	50.99923615336056
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	21.15787757395518
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	39.14574293135267
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	23.49446394785108
her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	13.526232277325029
he was silent.	228.98275858069871
i will have no reserves from you."	61.87248957093543
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	23.10343614964387
you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	22.001919369190755
having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	14.346376520077968
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	48.89027715276629
"very, very much.	120.62461330751539
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in the north.	24.539669956689984
lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	23.769925621927072
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that."	48.12093089095815
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."	22.193489730062502
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	15.042231998160023
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.	37.368027156874156
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.	31.009030506166724
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	93.0399500633352
but it is so strange!"	92.17290784955205
good bye."	241.81690279980384
