elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	546.8167325513441
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	1653.1167243788318
the effect was immediate.	361.48409912791647
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	1793.97881386468
and you saw the old housekeeper, i suppose?	651.100695481324
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	872.2596224292496

but if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	3142.7505447679478
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	1860.1704020842317
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	1615.4900303944341

the church ought to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."	1361.9973058723424
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh!	954.0274957533894
i cannot find out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	815.5062058621913
his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	1088.8835097372564
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	2177.600221554566
dear me!	94.48370999056056
at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	951.7756518735997
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he wants you in the library."	1209.8743649520713
his debts are to be paid, amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.	1483.9632828669703
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	2263.614803935929
his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	1093.7978470754251
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"	640.0468169795435
their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	1181.7034277018456
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	2166.1844857647106
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	2178.1309341102565
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	1093.2661807698996
chapter ii.	87.2378589933409
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"	537.8563430399257
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing."	2408.2353766332935
"la!"	58.012260394710204
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	569.0653566926251
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia," said she, "though i am not her particular friend.	554.4804909187243
but what is that to me?	254.39295666114538
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was her, i would not have put up with it.	1013.0871935884127
"indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	531.7830934938411
his marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "wished they might be happy."	1541.683414195715
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	1723.2811030219068
"you write uncommonly fast."	146.42808250540838
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament.	2008.536058675753
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	1958.029510498634
egerton, military library, whitehall.	235.7733502160271
but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	995.3671007190054
i rather wonder now at your knowing any."	437.60128564946024
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	1840.6828887801753
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	485.79130572711387
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.	768.2045272678847
the day passed much as the day before had done.	512.4900066092848
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	1895.063652733548
before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	1855.0786290790015
besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."	880.8723257176825
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	338.9367280310972
she will make him a very proper wife."	356.53919488023865
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."	477.3640961453141
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable."	571.9513910742895
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	1242.2532586381315
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	1742.876836255059
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"	1022.8756753212064
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	175.95276010984816
by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	1635.957967321279
you will be a very happy woman."	162.59246810289622
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	1435.174789802484
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	1662.3595373546766
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."	1140.7612609825546
said he, as he joined her.	172.0097638617436
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.	1627.0413950802765
why was he to be the judge?"	502.742530013469
see paragraph 1.c below.	370.7906647178739
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	553.3233920472494
but i must tell you how it went off.	287.37175911460616
"yes; but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	806.6949731846786
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	1841.1954615409109
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	1003.7867952837172
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	760.7694970915294
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?"	1708.0080374088818
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	1370.231593519685
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with."	281.19369434314376
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	1784.8285804543152
sir, i do indeed.	269.44985186539066
"you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	236.23763390859645
i shall now know how to act.	393.40582707055717
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins.	1661.8003586247255
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	1424.8687669698224
oh!	14.346523268075027
this matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."	623.7600815731247
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	933.7254989231232
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	1906.179993612493
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	681.2499104403418
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	465.0557247782243
chapter xviii.	61.44207151475285
but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	527.0742042733522
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	2140.8866275024275
but, lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	299.15847732814115
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	2149.0239465071745
the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	1764.7777803090405
i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	1061.6767476827722
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town."	834.488171277273
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	806.9372602828867
wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly sisters.	1998.2395377629616
you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."	1918.2308662232344
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	836.1456184286666
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	874.3102841287307
lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	2152.5951098440096
i will put on my things in a moment.	390.2062314833117
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	300.9425724762852
"i have sent for you on an affair of importance.	458.8262096461315
are the others coming out?"	466.3165782624319
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility, "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."	514.121134561275
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	931.5827038825421
you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	600.812248443323
it adds even another motive.	509.0759204588329
how was that possible?	450.4489786448611
these were the contents: "my dear harriet, "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am missed.	1539.674339361956
mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	607.3702148995725
for about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.	1848.3702938543304
her mind was less difficult to develope.	624.2124496750217
jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	1092.887907007471
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	552.967602567849
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	359.0072272250661
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in."	370.91493555927565
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	125.76076863480404
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly."	863.3257217598928
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	1700.8113400202353
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	587.5589711053066
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	1268.3339403351406
and when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.	2198.9921824236885
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."	877.7279178255358
had he done his duty in that respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	2025.812739057734
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham.	856.2852555996586
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	360.16176062943373
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	272.6206892023812
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	1086.4265920407117
and one of my own daughters.	249.8090651902992
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	1922.1288637009898
very nonsensical to come at all!	816.3966885179112
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	2090.640742434124
* * * * * in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	743.66130982527

tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."	470.3633192945994
you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	1326.7091894718826
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	2178.4898130090082
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	573.1576859588545
but the clothes, the wedding clothes!	487.5660394423282
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	448.02615582577494
elizabeth was delighted.	82.31425281833701
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	864.8240167653938
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	1241.106407369582
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"	848.9840160901765
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	906.1742972324475
chapter vi.	61.44207151475285
mr bennet could not have chosen better.	185.55248004068565
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	715.3195100991918
redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.	2189.197823680938
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him.	1599.5745272361273

"did not you?	97.63388606440557
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	1979.2238124072821
i dare say i shall soon see them here."	267.6419090895228
u.s.	191.14283340069838
said she.	40.23958881291898
this must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	1375.9594825018266
chapter xiii.	61.44207151475285
till this moment, i never knew myself."	415.4374540647289
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday.	1931.2657640479506
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her.	1760.1203391608226
"oh!	7.596391247223825
this was very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	2175.1226245043536
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	688.7075383621604
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas."	1481.9368311631792
their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	1134.2526783581236
he placed himself by her.	163.21125190259843
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	1091.7454668995638
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	737.0798723513795
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	1997.220415352792
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	1987.6938758417023
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	1831.2411568340265
and his answering immediately to the last question--oh!	352.0905469546187
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	757.5292709581989
"no.	36.77303175452414

and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	1449.858704302408
they will ruin your happiness.	241.27723546745167
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	330.5095964495307
his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	1041.7710561813155
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	1632.7648375324586
"mrs collins, you must send a servant with them.	303.7626244423041
"sometimes.	91.95103644756581
"how i long to see her again!	169.9858592862938
ii.	198.82710170490793
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.	2800.7761956132445
"my dear brother, "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	1283.532421091671
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	2611.667838211236
and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	1701.0622582690194
wickham is safe."	203.80682995678492
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	1411.955731092413
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	394.30702849473306
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."	600.0652743778854
wickham only shook his head.	316.8233383683258
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!	926.3547613526573
in three volumes.	126.44913412108318
stop me whilst you can."	506.47864350745044
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	906.6708196387418
and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in debt; but i hope this may be false."	1300.4143824117775
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	927.8164171527687
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."	529.0732658243529
lady catherine seemed pleased.	149.46631923853147
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	1814.7505969508406
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	1149.3433338186844
not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	2384.3944642633915
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."	610.980552929977
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in meryton."	356.2703004048101
mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	374.9115805183856
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	1470.1277274801917
"john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	1122.5453615712015
but every body is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i assure you.	757.2049167672661
1.f.5.	44.15539294892887
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	1836.0938713791525
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	2245.1245296845846
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to you."	1620.1264748815167
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	370.455967767913
to the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	930.8857765610375
after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	1733.3875768291912
"oh!	7.596391247223825
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned.	738.6103788458585
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added kitty.	481.75686464749646
your mother insists upon your accepting it.	457.10867163371455
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	704.1891951124057
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	2145.587452854947
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid.	2291.0756841835587
their manners are not equal to his."	470.6627833104658
she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	1574.2650000086362
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	1400.8775129326154
"how could you begin?"	140.63151100923432
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.	1520.7837639322827
mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	487.53376956647924
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	370.8450002641103
without a governess you must have been neglected."	406.8594478155004
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house.	972.7527045350123
"how strange!"	59.89112271877731
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	1191.6651115557158
he is come--mr bingley is come.--he is, indeed.	503.64001193202756
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	2296.094193393486
have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	1534.6925730379799
her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.	1588.638885836259
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	1243.4720583641579
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."	1363.0327214000383
elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.	616.2399844700176
my reasons for believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	2246.6788677418385
assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.	1480.406516558872
my sisters may write to me.	270.92517889428
after a short pause, her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	454.95601181980646
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	556.0820631276695
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	2275.155069937279
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative.	2513.9940011821805
"i must not decide on my own performance."	285.16431637717574
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley.	732.6598230438759
he did trace them easily to clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.	2814.5529869261904
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."	370.33796717789374
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	1532.0751254560585
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	446.2485475553648
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, "i can guess the subject of your reverie."	1240.3261859249437
it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.	1632.0632945199159
i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in mrs jenkinson's room.	1680.2142462951915
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	1433.3494285752377
his words seemed to imply it.	397.0300773669604
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	377.1437519505003
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied darcy.	626.6841608342462
the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	2127.0760066062135
we all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	1759.187584828019
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	1210.2926627533898
but i wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	729.6594454905928
"do you really think so?"	121.58503552274537
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	777.6525493079087
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party.	1078.993224692024
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"	475.7378574192037
all that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.	2767.0821391988334
when she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister.	1771.7599784151291
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	1267.2543429006837
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	915.1482632007808
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	362.78349959382626
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?	849.0915920230082
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.	625.4409472502545
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	1430.522092165909
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	2064.3756359315935
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	1678.3495155853377
i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	319.06905533430864
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what say you to the day?	437.4509793954181
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	727.112366024138
to know that her daughter would be married was enough.	555.8649492753855
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	1355.2367130615094
she had very little notice from any but him.	375.9408017752011
mr collins made his declaration in form.	421.80935700800705
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	1561.5345692394308
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	880.3154617176076
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	299.6227895323353
and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	2119.6376927364217
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	1729.2834784199147
"i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."	511.9870450425206
i will only add, god bless you.	424.3730698079454
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."	1737.5621146281362
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	1888.6483475175949
good or bad?"	209.28529095705008
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	450.0760064048512
the hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	1992.422335735747
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	254.15551696139212
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	232.97586717914635
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them.	621.1469060377203
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.	1039.5287521760208
are sufficiently known.	403.52959740290584
mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth, "miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	1550.2875972860822
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	1552.6930779898223
to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	1685.7806883139663
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	473.05564240867426
if she does not object to it, why should we?"	410.7431178991773
we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."	907.1562756197274
1813.	16.117565948606046
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."	299.3660936849225
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.	1238.724907624154
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	1601.7002264880805
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!	1242.345861986715
if he no longer cares for me, why silent?	852.8553485117433
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states.	1479.0913862492594
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	565.6607062398382
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at longbourn.	1612.7747804124385
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	2409.5120885684587
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	1244.295805430674
* * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	903.355265524568
make haste, and come down this moment."	438.66314925535306
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it.	1168.6868353775353
at length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	622.0287617277276
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	2339.3365712874897
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.	1430.5284163711774
what will wickham say?	245.002330521499
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented.	1592.879020999184
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	496.03802151576235
mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.	1043.6693951647062
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	708.4617018805022
mr bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	1359.8573156770926
i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	1321.5003336457085
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	918.5198248983328
i.	36.699872842297864
"i do not recollect that we did."	126.70402969371929
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	360.6121957046229
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	1267.210805282189
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	2225.0628812641426
cried lydia.	64.68018467222335
my father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	1598.5392491562254
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	1305.5026547327006
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	1920.488507287579
but you are always giving her the preference."	381.27331744986554
lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	1284.9914764213677
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	1656.948776134621
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley!	1421.3340913555437
but on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.	718.9624736846729
the gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	1371.22139114004
"is my father in town?"	249.59792358268038
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	1784.821370415853
his own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	2949.7511344452296
on entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	1643.3308155602256
said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	664.8379902417944
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	2455.5768398894875
"oh!	7.596391247223825
in the former were many good paintings; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	2104.169146463446
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy."	1548.6579947805792
the subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	542.6104173364604
the first week of their return was soon gone.	713.3049615855459
chapter xxiii.	177.08277659467373
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week.	1520.9750601740227
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	1417.7241984161633
they have at least that advantage."	260.15845971465916
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	1155.3680609515643
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	601.0324093472831
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?"	825.0122923907225
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	1066.8203809400386
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy!	466.557725362582
their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	3716.6655954459798
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	1929.8290443412823
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself.	810.622737433408
mrs collins knew not what to make of him.	343.2404150322204
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	327.2643871411752
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	416.1965676733728
but to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character!	1142.820095044677
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	741.4146288363836
"oh!	7.596391247223825
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	1439.0861922526105
he had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us.	1328.9488996212972
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."	813.7207323620285
if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	670.1172184123932
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	1105.2064058990968
when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	1218.2836303170336
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	1146.3634968628671
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	2570.476448281044
"most willingly."	117.5484025216882
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield.	1687.7881148442334
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	1382.016124939825
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	256.97910088968126
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	1886.86905652766
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable.	703.3377652110072
london: printed for t.	357.50116762909636
and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	1411.1819754476353
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with mr gardiner.	1501.4772248892593
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	413.81482643761353
you will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	1154.9068882443416
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	762.2894047539608
she wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	1772.7307259660759
to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	1525.937811888116
i must have employment and society.	321.5362467989336
if, indeed, it should be so!	277.65230649231484
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	1344.9430141977991
you know i have.	161.37773635270963
they were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	2011.7821722136705
chapter v.	61.44207151475285
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	104.64398998919371
she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.	1406.7209438706054
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	1279.6320902502403
i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	796.7467317915235
i never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	1015.3528414392584
thank heaven!	103.22495356997929
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	2539.7306189140872
that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	1608.1581881055308
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to table.	453.55249736608306
chapter xvii.	61.44207151475285
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."	690.0497517471442
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	1090.6760106112074
she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	2057.6185718165075
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there."	364.9201928060044
"take whatever you like, and get away."	475.743506300677
their powers of conversation were considerable.	792.8869290154637
she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows."	1887.5286982007299
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile.	1405.8680926063666
my visit was not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out.	1273.8544045360836
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	2198.6435137487206
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you."	1207.9474573723592
"i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man."	621.9242645798017
his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	1870.2536149417792

my friend has an excellent understanding--though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	1785.3559197970978
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	411.9898349015165
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	1678.437168077616
london: printed for t.	357.50116762909636
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	594.812282379937
she has known him only a fortnight.	358.5485474898248
why did she come?	366.9896640512862
i am going away myself."	88.59950041244794
what is it you are talking of?	404.97517814984013
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	2264.2921913518794
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	1857.6004382301182
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	477.0011073679864
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	1009.6167691185811
is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	2447.3646651648246
if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.	2135.193714164313
but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	1102.378660171941
he had never had the slightest suspicion.	403.5301497840946
their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	787.3201489965686
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	268.5229673179121
she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	903.678646330184
but i am at his disposal.	169.95591245443302
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.	1146.01636313518
"and what did she say?"	146.51033611730116
little more than half a day's journey.	854.4039147588333
you refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	1383.7646377783474
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	1669.8341330871842
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	552.8946923758207
he scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	1116.8437902677038
his choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	1386.7927205567541
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	1432.6847089038142
he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	641.49563720471
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	1441.4091289687367
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the trouble of practising.	1430.2522098789989
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	975.4776763109551
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	592.7677658992309
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you will drink to our good journey.	1134.2422052527702
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	1736.300985409516
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!	482.9269573786375
she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	1818.7029774191694
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	1203.4942599802218
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.	1886.1525857883698
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield.	1285.3689239916496
i only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it.	924.1506720350893
for my part, mr bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently.	1538.9475231396236
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.	1561.5302536627155
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	2144.2674645946927
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved in civility."	1273.6459227275182
they followed her into the dining-parlour.	556.4580216252458
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	1095.9644830953205
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy returned within the stated time.	2387.9896434856437
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.	1946.116624660499
i had not believed it possible."	154.6803422711595
the carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	755.6299840614356
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	556.2245616259049
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	1913.520916494646
"oh!	7.596391247223825
it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been.	1158.19286512645
his character is thereby complete."	255.8251868862456
"no, not at all."	43.54996808973146
"what will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are!	842.2830252197174
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	369.0236602159488
"fitzwilliam darcy."	79.4966393985698
said he, smiling.	133.69289522617927
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to rosings.	1259.5292494946368
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement.	811.2436250974976
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	1239.8101162501723
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer."	231.15017844109093
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.	674.1593578282941
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	406.3080740598754
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"	919.7730158055305
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."	1420.6091624822668
"to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."	877.44580916744
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	212.6381913936115
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	912.5201065730853
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you will wait on him of course."	282.4384918209905
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	1370.981576085062
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	561.4016884256698
chapter ix.	61.44207151475285
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	1623.4106113815487
but in matters of greater weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	886.1567492302645
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	1070.9093457327795
"i desire you will do no such thing.	215.5074258738621
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	552.0130135845719
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	2162.876138368409
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	1698.0136369114211
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	946.8209325250147
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."	966.5791724109063
heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?	835.7405381784827
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	854.8164156232002
the next was in these words.	280.01965960781354
"are you, indeed?	232.6874063298091
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	1172.0875240891987
mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	953.5608266286099
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	2100.576240580298
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	1050.1430017614239
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	1800.9341852826594
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	2058.4957816595584
she wrote even to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	1383.4191562089288
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	888.9019091033284
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire.	282.3626301622789
it cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened.	573.7178492651801
an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	1720.7097511978427
you need not.	79.75485323248381
the adieu is charity itself.	391.8254895584484
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	1410.970312598777
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	121.6174586109738
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--she could have added, "a young man too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner!"	1811.554787509926
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	456.3905569189302
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	840.7525131506377
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	1910.3586076673469
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	611.7667520650175
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	819.1279537656915
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	547.7251006984446
1.e.8.	30.002190201055924
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	488.6846057982411
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy.	1746.7434712734307
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses.	1739.9103636226428
but is it certain, absolutely certain?"	531.1448313201953
if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	1192.8016712373922
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	1435.6321091394614
take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	984.1204435376364
well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	853.9625471987065
accompanied by a violent yawn.	1077.131693477864
"there is nothing the matter with me.	148.95695610502926
"you need not distress yourself.	181.82755175636808
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.	1736.6847060286443
you cannot have been always at longbourn."	270.4958080260385
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	882.2677463750141
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	675.7034360398836
and when you have given your ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	665.0646645772536
but against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	1401.7552642064297
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."	1239.9555329424995
mr darcy!	22.579075148550356
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard, and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	2141.883983980079
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	357.5221169559747
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	1589.7364085538832
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas.	346.8307467668864
but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	834.9502912477677
as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	1618.1602696951645
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	997.2842438202406
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	959.6218516737487
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	931.895876744154
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"	1674.9473839129141
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	601.7148662924542
chapter xix.	61.44207151475285
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	399.55837067581905
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	1154.7423499905335
i expected you to stay two months.	467.27444140102676
he found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	1389.1057644434193
but whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	2176.1835699123517
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.	2242.551002707531
she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	1002.2067393992015
"hate you!	136.0482058273256
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford.	942.5171751446853
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins.	1007.7447231522475
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him.	1753.94469647532
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	1429.1330812915833
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	1541.612426130663
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	798.9461999434226
the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them.	648.9938992867523
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old."	1223.2246650737923
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller."	691.8738919897191
they met again on sunday, and then i saw him too.	672.9684800314116
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	1478.6992509469678
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	2234.16344925767
why any fear of detection?	587.9610942783764
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	1987.235430846463
he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	1899.022267111441
she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	1377.0300972257978
"you were mr bingley's first choice."	191.500107526643
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	2579.467706875577
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	1430.099287360126
chapter xvi.	61.44207151475285
you shall not defend her, though it is charlotte lucas.	564.8195709598021
but no such recollection befriended her.	237.73942517171153
i have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	767.7099825638115
she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr darcy, she was directly retreating.	1644.3272416570899
you both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	927.4983264350182
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	1538.5687570342677
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	1201.3638030913612
she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	764.0105795231992
my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for.	419.13727706858384
i have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	865.65067144405
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	393.33402017391325
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	897.0659560920861
by many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	1859.8705158060488
my dear, dear jane, i am so happy!	163.34508688970007
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	834.2945565202286
elizabeth smiled.	80.81252186076651
"yes, ma'am, all."	77.04089169861835
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "i can hardly be just to him."	284.0727791264457
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	1697.4055864088903
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins, and i will never see you again if you do."	331.57769654280446
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	1813.319196403499
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	619.7261758023247
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	796.8017504494597
we must not all expect jane's good fortune."	329.3425837978381
since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	1243.2486812401494
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers."	1540.5182520297365
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to understand it.	826.5241687191582
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	2310.527336388059
it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	1009.5016342298339
"i am all astonishment.	87.05149269209076
mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	794.5951955384286
how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!	2322.99239790868
"so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find.	500.27820095288746
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	2092.001789163957
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	2135.581342386141
"to-morrow fortnight."	98.50602290252979
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	1068.413279102935
jane shook her head.	151.05545194392738
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	566.1270150726159
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	597.6168220097559
till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	495.18278928177693
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following, as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	2728.7047799759844
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte.	2151.0443458002114
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	526.2495937407072
"oh!"	13.041208659043962
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	990.9233717662612
and who knows what may happen?	700.8475000011475
he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."	1877.246366029842
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."	1259.0883273273655
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i could."	1664.1795745611234
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	955.8840732261342
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	1842.77026499908
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all."	1063.5033389464854
"does that young lady know mr darcy?"	330.9835222227674
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh.	1921.4225266813346
the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	2427.9475676528746
such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	2184.4174684857826
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	986.196645005074
* * * * * mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	330.83507084850334
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	1161.655132555556
oh, lydia!"	108.67534879419563
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.	2728.608815661125
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	388.27641809684627
nothing could be more delightful!	332.18128795809054
"i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	430.24996656674716
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	1671.764118286543
all was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	1064.0086105753048
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	1744.7707297988957
"i am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before?	503.4647463402982
they are gone off together from brighton.	401.4879744284882
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	2549.1562138351815
"yet why did he come?"	296.70026322546255
"you forget that i have made no answer.	155.104239134926
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	1919.7404067044004
he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	1794.3545384240088
he did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september, than any body else in the country.	886.8234488724365
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	1008.6331638121753
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."	647.730712503093
i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.	1024.3942190951723
his principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	1719.7784262948323
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court."	484.59353002928395
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	1689.9265221893188
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	479.2288821621589
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak what i think."	497.5203075380603
i am very, very sorry.	171.11893738144116
he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention."	676.6539786267639
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	426.7611196356058
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	981.548072211302
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	1779.7584695510907
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	2109.3979729922603
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."	629.0957399212639
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	624.9116964914863
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?	350.3018422416867
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr collins too!--why should he have it more than anybody else?"	1752.2433681905388
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	1713.8829020480625
"mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	868.6879706629194
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	948.1832274532677
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	1817.1458426175318
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at st james's.	1827.4669302670857
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	1946.299347519326
the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would i give to hear your strictures on them!"	1538.6281228154448
and when i returned home, the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	859.057319479556
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	626.5925715567846
my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal."	287.13855311211614
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends.	1462.3117209162704
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."	327.10386259910564
you have done all this!	205.41615088042704
teazing, teazing, man!	850.0476166557012
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	1194.8086462036051
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	1189.8072645579493
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	2132.93473164695
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	1237.4312376776115
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	1094.7897160777397
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful.	401.23785424909636
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	1398.7896272572502
"you are uniformly charming!"	111.69175431313168
younger sons cannot marry where they like."	683.2984046281322
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	1364.5018251812758
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	394.4056401493286
it is really too distressing.	203.2284504618847
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	1252.6545981702113
pride & prejudice.	194.2449555635009
your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."	1534.0066200931576
one must speak a little, you know.	428.2926258947293
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	1232.097093450467
then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----" "if he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!	892.0281691339405
"oh!	7.596391247223825
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	1609.868493993231
a lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	1756.6163184043255
poor dear child!	415.53689530915483
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	589.5092889081373
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	551.9941529381732
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	721.7637341806304
the girls stared at their father.	429.583549979713
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, "i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, 'she a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."	1942.8643274895023
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	662.5205673585424
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	162.67273347204932
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	1951.6979330751374
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	576.3689365764893
at such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."	619.3603138188744
'tis as good as a lord!	780.769169803745
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."	935.0541852844907
here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	2468.52291346819
my feelings in every respect forbid it.	276.05944609659684
but so they always are.	392.3360133464086
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	883.5236597433499
mr darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	165.64326312852006
were questions with which she amused herself.	648.3252794132528
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	1236.2087940819404
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.	1925.6527132106355
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	1467.180922092687
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	1254.3256234966393
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	693.2129060505124
"if he does not come to me, then," said she, "i shall give him up for ever."	203.38446458059354
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	539.7147387889214
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	944.3233022391183
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	342.031245155086
he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	2248.985290596221
how could i be so silly as to wish it!	724.4510457768462
"then, who taught you?	292.4154407697374
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	750.6679067649246
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	1473.4290557773988
do not distress me by the idea.	448.1170427942138
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."	638.2399851752907
jane looked at her doubtingly.	260.3505154178249
if you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.	1449.3025447340544
"mr collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	2106.1783857370833
"some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me.	541.4847970084938
"'tis too much!"	236.30650717980635
where, where is my uncle?"	476.1458410059048
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	694.9867516481427
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	296.6750177082568
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"	968.5349102530713
to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.	865.3242660750308
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	1441.9165602754347
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	1959.1685282956423
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	2578.9895508857644
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	2575.172870510113
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	773.0769939043495
in three volumes.	126.44913412108318
his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	1032.8517246741364
"la!	57.35399169648249
but are you pleased, jane?	482.20400299161815
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	2234.6148036764557
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"	702.0366101060097
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	2112.809221688838
from what can it proceed?	538.7067331514511
it would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	628.4063103668578
mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	1258.66357679534
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him."	550.5748176197411
what made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	1286.8365456914692
"well, well, and so mr bingley is coming down, sister," (for mrs philips first brought her the news.) "well, so much the better.	1046.5229171843703
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	919.346859623224
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia once.	1362.3588457620444
"i never saw such a woman.	115.4758170232773
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	257.4687424478923
i thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	523.2409437791054
"has your governess left you?"	259.4387358476036
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	1245.6013190543365
it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	728.758193891511
"heaven forbid!--that would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me such an evil."	993.8741313109253
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	177.34566459944517
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he did--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr robinson."	1381.2090046529336
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort.	1379.1510676098096
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	239.08145461243387
"can i have the carriage?"	185.01493118255868
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	1785.6560028776928
our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."	1858.8797942020308
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	696.308795153561
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	1581.7513455212545
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	2629.8332941930653
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	332.135579919919
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.	1753.6124563235512
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	1386.7863338163797
you never see a fault in any body.	618.9853782557731
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet came from it.	832.2482058543106
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	2277.439767567192
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.	1599.496789096771
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	1369.7532673056253
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	2151.84081561027
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	759.6043696088234
my uncle!"	98.93337838561774
"you are then resolved to have him?"	183.03890709929343
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"	429.81391389605574
but, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	1070.7193131015315
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	742.9563749119801
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	1047.0117420283261
by you, i was properly humbled.	479.8966752571577
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum."	1432.3138460990708
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	1402.9737764188117
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself.	173.209884402724
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!	1867.901419556476
there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	1307.1391335211326
but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	1696.1266499051044
they have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	1128.507204484072
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	2963.9717673175087
chapter ii.	87.2378589933409
1.f.1.	44.15539294892887
he still loves me, and we are engaged."	418.1129412248145
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.	688.788127453162
you are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	310.0807080291047
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	1534.2117074029406
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	1667.549878791978
within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	2154.228874760847
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!	1108.759122894135
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	643.7553916022125
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think."	456.7875972295106
on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	2108.711585275958
i speak feelingly.	187.52924533172052
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.	416.9728256713735
and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.	461.4064327285433
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy.	708.7815851263844
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	409.38827249043425
the loo table, however, did not appear.	430.42114124415787
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, i am sure.	699.6881340833796
i will not tell you what it is.	202.42320629630547
she is all affability and condescension, and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	1210.2218424426494
chapter xiv.	61.44207151475285
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	389.85426760091184
elizabeth was distressed.	74.46117547428118
mrs gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	659.6103551806442
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject."	419.69458726759734
"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley, and under your orders."	708.2015057176241
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her, saying, "i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	1178.8577128407662
in short, i will do my best."	310.96886627648877
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."	451.03655538758045
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	891.355866475692
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	1018.5045811195579
my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	954.5873983560855
"you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	619.3347927287551
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"	440.6977633430271
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."	687.2707638360083
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	1876.6944482058796
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	279.90032768246607
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	856.7099643221106
if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!	1687.8039386237876
"not as you represent it.	211.43166412405597
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.	1645.7339925775334
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	1069.1340536791151
"his misfortunes!"	103.32677606927352
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	327.9831685863324
i do not know who is good enough for him."	123.38539066849218
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	952.3674771009162
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	1488.9769930135958
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	1880.4681541888688
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away.	299.41000420353924
how strange must it appear to him!	812.988104989453
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	577.4907630531824
there's for you!	318.7512885976297
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	1290.5577056492955
but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1069.33618001325
give me farther particulars.	724.0808474793344
what is your own opinion?"	238.20117425126256
a little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	424.0631932788881
but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	1124.2841796947612
the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	2233.873597675588
i am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	480.49439254235074
he has given in all his debts; i hope at least he has not deceived us.	983.5337029785056
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	433.53065418727317
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	2175.713664418684
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	627.4260227210806
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	665.4856615487341
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.	855.2883950508452
if this be the case, he deserves you.	470.2425989158039
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family.	781.1259604113569
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	2286.2108702383903
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	1510.295204152258
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	277.6962857858831
my dear lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	467.867024993461
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	866.6110105711774
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.	680.040087541289
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	2129.4499247304543
"i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.	1560.2439007917649
its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	2478.5547470373576
she was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."	1426.5209902437612
"a place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	983.7078572123313
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	657.2063715347647
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy.	391.4561021541643
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	1506.5515238749215
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	677.6615334971177
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	226.89708218677086
but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	2271.0578214396796
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	2097.1430923502066
cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner.	1425.702615361314
"not so hasty, if you please.	300.87062437602685
"your examination of mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	449.07998683306585
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	922.4347937517649
i am most seriously displeased."	140.4897311117269
she comes to us to-day.	416.4201452794732
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	2068.312072300296
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	2019.593087232316
"i am sure i know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	1078.1158245297543
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling.	2243.397207862749
he begged pardon for having displeased her.	467.23581824005856
but they did pass away, and mr and mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn.	899.9200252645996
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	233.65727038880405
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton.	559.3226870643821
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	1925.1978882597307
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	1529.9131706359944
i wish i could see her.	98.77684024324607
"what think you of books?"	167.99045637127972
i pity, though i cannot help blaming her.	420.8549200790366
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	1461.5550879609038
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	1170.7036286192736
so genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every body.--that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."	1767.4155361277228
was not a man to be trusted.	440.5945762810103
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	1023.5043067086017
"i honour your circumspection.	208.5276116660193
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	698.5289493110395
but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is.	450.32486476643396
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	1634.2883584270396
"true.	39.09189937525261
let wickham be your man.	450.48367901144877
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	1574.9653504602868
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	1128.6259552244785
she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	2039.5078680593774
"ah!	34.78074896461365
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	1685.7671600771528
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	2627.5545332741267
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	481.1831058383517
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind.	1806.3217168781414
mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	754.3732186906173
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."	1124.3275343744533
mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before."	1579.9320330007004
he has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one.	873.9526979786348
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	236.89168835960734
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."	1636.78172968696
well, he is a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	913.2295393241722
it is nearly fifty miles."	172.6678759126047
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."	401.06331713842826
during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	2745.7667561884637
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, i assure you.	471.0777204170648
my mind was more agreeably engaged.	626.0394923038945
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."	454.8128515031394
"you quite mistook mr darcy.	136.00598166342274
"how near it may be to mine, i cannot pretend to say.--you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	792.4527500681606
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	519.7504019972238
"if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside," cried bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."	646.8335068630126
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."	356.47314334824483
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c.	1542.391303022563
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.	513.3585711837246
"oh!	7.596391247223825
then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	1224.2836419847974
sir william had been delighted with him.	295.87470600212066
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	3261.157254424702
