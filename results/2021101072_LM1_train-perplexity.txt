mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire.	474.9252025636197
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	631.8953823063993
after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	618.3817367628398
but he is a liberal master, i suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."	332.005381654828
elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.	134.6774995192236
"all young ladies accomplished!	150.39002208674233
what has she to do with it?	268.30692662010847
she was teazed by mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.	380.6266899207881
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	947.8914227071242
i am the happiest creature in the world.	77.16847088215039
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her."	162.88725741931975
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of that, i can assure you, he informed me himself."	435.34260366429885
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	544.7838015042636
i would go and see her, if i could have the carriage."	214.09497048513433
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.	634.8972729345649
"yes, sir; but i do not know when that will be.	125.51257873327485
they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	324.8884308409476
so imprudent a match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	441.1085777541397
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	532.400301631976
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."	313.9647491066125
"there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	361.1822616950953
many small donations ($ 1 to $ 5 , 000 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs.	837.294240809371
i had not an idea of it."	73.51297213596418
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	719.658443470903
i take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not, but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	510.44435458296863
she was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	673.1333875458603
but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for?	400.5068870698604
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	635.9066807165501
mr bingley arrived.	84.6771008241418
"your first position is false.	159.3953648879238
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	602.3000578236118
but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	653.4567712683754
"are you not diverted?"	92.5154466592536
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	498.8493742146996
"let us sit down.	96.06042168382683
after sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth, "i hope you are well, miss bennet.	294.37633564930223
is not it so, mrs bennet?"	153.8510062533465
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its being created."	190.94588377822436
make haste, make haste.	277.19521653627004
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.	487.40031561715824
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	661.9628672773053
every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	326.96176029493733
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets.	155.46595343459134
"of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	348.6789870559382
let me mend it for you.	142.17339698473896
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet.--they had several children.	487.33155748337947
with them he is remarkably agreeable."	178.6899274021527
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.	643.9083394838308
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park.	282.4418086050591
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	441.3136246329434
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	525.1578759602254
they may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."	447.0620364809193
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	255.07618203693798
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	608.8975435875387
i have a high respect for your nerves.	196.5454373140024
bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	373.22268166051344
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	348.0320209186656
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	271.93283188636514
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed."	364.33376395482225
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	855.9932651830493
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	575.5388954831135
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."	411.29128651335606
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	412.78660863439967
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	703.2256840399026
have you never happened to see her there?"	224.02286377391354
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do, when i tell you all."	237.39455483021362
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	326.60748561969785
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	313.0028503804911
the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.	456.1647293369019
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	208.67084579029566
mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure."	178.47641028300868
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."	440.7898040869875
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	817.8721863814443
it is mr bingley i am sure.	93.51515571383496
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	809.1682793077254
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more."	331.1028174304799
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	492.2821702976464
we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	712.1832304177669
he heard her with astonishment.	148.64233493401073
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	190.53582159079556
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	626.5855710052663
"but upon my honour i do not.	98.54084808178347
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."	572.5803451717749
nonsense, how can you talk so!	270.7851362154149
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	633.9266571921611
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."	177.15003364881048
i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced."	151.01999731021047
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had."	211.28396483110066
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	156.68011509138054
"i am sure i shall break mine," said lydia.	88.7460156346548
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to."	311.734254333426
you are so strange!	104.47684373288925
oh!	14.346523268075027
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother lady catherine.	548.5962907595906
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	295.21590997807704
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.	677.795579166693
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	331.92266572730534
neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."	703.1365140562298
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	611.4604953020684
"but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	531.0184890764262
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	209.69900343990355
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight.	384.76925914603595
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	235.07314889722184
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	677.0069762333937
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in london.	375.6598697897443
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."	289.4571887139478
you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."	338.5370903759506
"which do you mean?"	75.07215222822809
he was well, but so much engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	244.2286287783265
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did.	276.4322036920324
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	454.54481264885254
"not that i shall though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."	397.45297381633924
she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	596.1441230153208
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	198.15843376734415
no, no, this is not likely.	180.81371570437102
said mrs bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	396.5367683640041
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	293.94774445911804
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals."	703.176993710267
when mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	598.8609847945289
is this to be endured!	231.7861124950063
cried his wife impatiently.	146.22776526066156
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	815.5924771010572
never mind miss lizzy's hair."	246.1086759842766
she directly replied, "you need not be frightened.	217.13557796996884
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.	696.8660960558221
"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	198.77013285092113
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	808.1261283528202
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	238.2711964866973
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	398.5355488341919
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."--it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	618.0356615816544
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	671.5667750322029
it was very little less.	90.87670036595844
miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	505.70281478076714
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	574.9310947558849
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	485.6024930410614
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	699.6399315487556
"oh!	7.596391247223825
but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	395.27562331696146
but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself."	669.9357487513896
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	719.274027146174
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	175.6720864765508
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.	305.3940028483221
i always said it must be so, at last.	169.7073630801256
remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."	636.4398179926484
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	680.3637817693328
mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	480.5884358935531
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	978.3318305595275
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	356.4551685929077
"well, and what news does it bring?	177.042910615868
if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	451.88081484702116
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	447.416437913891
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart.	748.1152477314936
you may have drawn him in."	125.26176559013018
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?	440.1008852942219
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	352.152299934788
mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	711.4476862581971
both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	583.3442881931848
sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	694.6510283053735
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr darcy they had only seen at church.	528.1565495470566
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley.	262.6077619065495
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	737.2019845815289
he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."	401.9806028717285
1.d.	98.22308197624962
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	169.92066580645596
and so, darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!	694.6807048104026
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret.	375.01080685098265
during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	365.8652181632625
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	436.79922734588007
"i am glad i bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	332.46954210618
the second began.	90.91748850631991
mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	566.9647671761177
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted.	322.66162862252577
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	292.6132076892558
when this was done, she had a less active part to play.	382.6378858329439
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	187.10375872739763
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	193.76873747891574
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london, mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	688.3168243540164
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	354.14305881537666
i am so pleased--so happy.	150.88248922035672
"oh!	7.596391247223825
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.	841.4311264546686
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	354.31642580762934
the supposition did not pain her.	152.1849752697649
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	185.14887926185318
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	592.8804790783711
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.	476.7003138310408
as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	400.5907990518454
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	345.00334214217804
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet.	785.3947981010278
follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without."	501.769674009714
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.	796.2971100958225
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	435.5948829282605
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	395.07071124426045
she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	706.8352973305593
chapter viii.	49.077036267764335
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen.	458.1450345281992
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	372.28293022509115
"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	738.739337566312
you are safe from me."	72.13442000516993
he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	288.2812745064062
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	341.979711082452
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	126.54490364255756
on distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.	544.320063170562
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	482.84694308537917
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	732.557620388325
mrs bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	409.7207552061841
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	283.27072847730534
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.	640.7675350812655
chapter xi.	49.077036267764335
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	433.2009185385697
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	490.20163472604094
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.	585.1477961587544
our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character.	601.7404095850313
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	314.8876305564433
"and i have another favour to ask.	111.99753818986785
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	185.41830992605077
"it must not be thought of.	104.54848378964665
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	610.1190982549065
and gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth called out, "dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	357.26070754089955
mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.	658.4557055758519
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	881.6668063819171
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	774.631584654118
said elizabeth.	27.947965846046525
cried mrs gardiner.	80.57114428318884
"indeed i do not dare."	61.44504115867449
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	660.616177015735
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	531.1519711007388
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her.	185.83139067534785
i believe i have now told you every thing.	194.23304596965994
he now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as well as of mr darcy.	646.6068587581614
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.	410.53416753837814
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "this walk is not wide enough for our party.	418.70550373467626
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	285.6383519798192
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	232.47002563939202
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	209.4481656966587
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	124.46295102467283
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	265.64884859198594
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."	273.4476807361258
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	479.3057697409476
"what is it you mean?"	67.75153977335184
there could not exist in the world two men, over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence.	544.3823279830027
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	675.4857395166055
the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth's intimate friend.	473.3839117220713
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	135.67632834133428
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james's.	789.7817613989064
he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	266.4224141118726
i rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	568.0126768231171
"it did.	38.77009683601764
"i beg your pardon.	51.20230916239571
"oh!	7.596391247223825
[illustration: dove-dale] pride & prejudice.	280.664937321186
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	303.5644583000595
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	85.05026422575494
the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	769.7675545428292
oh!	14.346523268075027
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	456.6552327015122
mr darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	280.9861917180757
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	261.47663274128377
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."	241.69644995954866
she has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	410.4524255691561
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way.	697.4533472023815
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	178.76933153192778
"these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature.	395.9830089493252
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."	441.33981682198305
can it be really so!	231.8226055905826
the officers will find women better worth their notice.	291.4660933808067
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	199.67387988731193
how he lived i know not.	159.79634667571716
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	342.8325174264881
its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	497.8220867430691
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	555.5476729485631
lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.	845.3404318521976
i do not deserve it.	50.76576744894551
cried he.	62.10572284774307
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	443.81160563901506
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	396.8983300170783
vol.	63.468596081134955
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.	356.5402604191395
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	201.37118952339392
lady catherine seemed resigned.	104.89244320267714
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	109.45079544385824
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	469.73558561873756
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	333.2761315691293
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	391.19036582832416
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	261.994180369971
i don't know.	112.05579734538533
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	712.1986674949311
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.	707.0258903744169
as yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	665.7706940963199
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her.	362.1416682581456
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	551.6223396784636
what does he say?	132.0026972011509
wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	586.865052803351
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	508.8353532616949
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	478.5786236505795
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."	261.0000810739862
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!	444.5569702882439
i know how much you dislike him."	97.52567902736385
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	646.2635416744308
mr bennet replied that he had not.	95.49551396980152
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	827.0764321195078
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	730.8927573434829
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	335.50347688725395
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	117.50836628276667
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	483.20327770415014
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	363.31973607019404
"i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail.	255.3177161704528
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!	783.4000778944777
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!	175.17848258205385
his attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	163.49463734785988
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	733.6163082714621
chapter xiv.	61.44207151475285
we passed each other several times.	260.4285713597809
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should be deceived again.	421.9135425945548
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	369.7506309646701
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	230.18710745828898
it will save me a world of trouble and economy.	369.02371700770505
"yes, all of them, i think.	87.5522506621176
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	492.3722273091902
i ought not to have said a word about it.	163.86319892628143
chapter xii.	49.077036267764335
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	702.6135507885824
and it was not wholly without foundation.	118.50704635837036
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley.	823.4505120905179
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	461.7088998196293
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	678.2284984377893
every body said how well she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	618.2339913677738
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	475.09883905297716
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."	381.52161886312837
i am so happy.	52.65546549742934
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.	652.8837160300436
it is evident that you belong to the first circles.	295.9040786696065
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	624.8301556229097
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	692.7609854590405
then shewing her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	506.12687014123793
"you know nothing of the matter.	85.1691677872345
and to see dear wickham too!	227.40064616407878
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged.	489.06830865130314
he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	234.71583377135659
chapter v.	61.44207151475285
"lizzy, you must not do so.	78.55748514602529
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	193.27930744784942
yet now i must believe you," cried jane.	249.16046090380644
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	311.30232652843574
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	205.15577577212517
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	87.96335360187297
but enough of this.	93.7708975295868
"you are over scrupulous surely.	100.49387309656834
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	625.4742660363381
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	477.09661400409163
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	605.1447842997014
she cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving wickham.	410.89626522142544
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	709.1112844531574
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	496.7895541470463
adieu.	98.08281419181343
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy, were to entertain each other.	366.88146136672754
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	521.8155491750225
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!	656.4628454706078
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	556.6965403866274
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	802.8926032258931
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.	615.2228163743844
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	629.9418940366743
1.c.	79.61734884793758
as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	735.2933507499341
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	154.27424562866926
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.	750.0886657350368
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.	360.76116410178565
and there was my aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	684.0484664733428
but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	580.2836517799284
"with my mother up stairs.	126.52710344521064
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	772.893428180594
not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	569.2838161853241
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	704.4852342539596
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	574.7123218796593
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.	548.2677243538293
mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	282.41345617576496
i am not equal to it.	53.375046019734704
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	775.1933185747274
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	330.7297509011669
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged.	460.392592502576
we had better go into the avenue."	158.76239200264382
"how strange this is!	122.42854918840926
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	676.2917142714274
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he feared w.	594.5478655684158
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	703.8817214402072
of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	497.2122109768715
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy.	513.3257547954775
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"	317.91092338176065
oh!	14.346523268075027
his appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	661.1069889490468
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."	176.05732851761053
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!	418.85834351474716
"my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	143.14209845816134
her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.	807.7917678968856
unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only child) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.	830.8456729586675
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"	270.28877668311645
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	281.4264777216059
i have not that pain.	74.55883670254288
1.e.6.	30.002190201055924
"it keeps him in good humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	188.92264541497798
i speak nothing but the truth.	164.91545954668047
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of affection to myself."	494.848814934666
he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	444.1746450286776
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	455.6678445710176
perhaps he thought her too young.	307.56897454584026
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	259.3258578650571
oh!	14.346523268075027
"that is as it happens.	103.56827300703344
oh, lizzy!	66.15775354380096
the others have been gone on to scarborough, these three weeks."	313.2633839574222
we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."	604.8947710620031
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.	303.5260878822726
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	877.0707677909617
"what could he mean?	99.93814757620186
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."	434.5515041284365
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	438.6393903861997
"i never heard that it was."	49.73084376241159
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious.	742.1376661097494
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	776.6127008193262
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.	711.7251606579587
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	393.40880777848696
"mrs annesley is with her.	110.18686449213526
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	132.5712552121152
"and that i suppose is one of your sisters."	117.72418638636665
he had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	655.0988269356061
it was to be such a secret!"	97.78337356215428
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	554.5996182116914
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money."	356.0358865141938
i need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	831.1680668871526
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy.	267.20091642201294
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	418.9647029083378
thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	620.2636325346291
it was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	725.0685607117413
he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	358.6546905730025
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford."	269.09969288988475
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.	682.840374369485
here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.	1000.8579659405053
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.	334.9186368289087
"it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	365.8298934336686
upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	539.7561218926137
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed.	672.1478218308993
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	132.23484407351538
and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.	707.4228252689394
"very much."	31.55390057895115
"not yet," replied jane.	87.75325359450714
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	236.6052220269904
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	403.83633026500377
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	681.0228476388069
the tête-à-tête surprised them.	89.38371404200085
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	534.2091966169577
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	467.47549596975637
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with.	343.9096736785286
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	686.9563714231178
they have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	454.792607384408
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	238.63279979032959
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	128.78480066976226
but however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.	386.3261820333581
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	387.99248878865336
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	250.83898979644724
you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done for the young people.	331.60758147832223
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	535.2571300352034
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	301.65609648316087
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."	881.6578681360933
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit.	724.7078774165074
my father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property.	686.8317696432624
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	366.1301137031809
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	464.6159980048873
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	790.0810458806593
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.	182.05097230532292
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	350.58304853451176
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	812.1978971942523
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	503.003314721441
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	521.5762852773767
but think no more of the letter.	126.28425011219025
i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	441.65904582696385
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family!	414.5773342372014
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	441.7314920061447
"yes--that is what makes it amusing.	148.9660669077342
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	304.6541328990172
the moral will be perfectly fair.	212.13961065573287
in every view it is unaccountable!"	171.11247138080716
that lady i suppose is your mother."	201.2006464637931
"no, no.	37.79619856956704
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	136.29081148309632
"my dear, dear lydia!"	42.395086144245816
their reception at home was most kind.	292.31939736324455
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	651.9882752282346
it became her turn to listen.	242.8113052283127
she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	648.7156470530509
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him.	739.3446480934098
charlotte did not stay much longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	437.4289833340051
at last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	427.6847219269676
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	686.4092439759372
but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	422.30859880054084
said jane.--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her."	148.0425321743518
it cannot last long.	96.44769230230185
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to think."	165.52667909258815
"you mistake me, my dear.	95.58877860640776
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	325.23963867226144
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."	551.1740552470809
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	558.4911268642393
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	616.5225585512741
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	484.1336347103242
nobody can tell what i suffer!--but it is always so.	300.59659416499215
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now, mr darcy.--i talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."	496.7022675141119
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her-- "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"	644.4896293225362
"so much the better.	64.01039523835736
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	311.54303383748334
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	554.5415569242218
the dejection was almost universal.	192.9296746650485
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	308.93061456395696
she has two nieces of her own.	141.56102553523024
"no--why should he?	143.3700808277319
on that head, therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	474.3740774776777
well, colonel fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	266.42739632640206
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy."	276.44084373689896
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	295.6427520793609
it was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	713.7909326359031
"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."	337.8577304424678
sir william did not say much.	160.41043752353087
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	113.53161788829749
"and is this all?"	71.06801577739586
could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	442.47534591631694
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months.	673.4585430066105
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	533.014295807555
my father bears it better.	128.3876575788435
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	167.29052509440737
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london.	731.8561024981873
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."	363.4940765988763
"i should imagine not."	40.57269839276642
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy."	300.1335490448136
a young man, such as you describe mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	499.5691393774032
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.	351.20468106918696
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."	309.17569733242544
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	372.3157269507992
you thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	393.4784689859602
her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire.	547.5103932997289
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	270.52365901791075
"care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	391.4344918241362
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	592.810854139864
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	258.45923631705296
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	117.63265253105595
and his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	393.667003560166
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	309.5641863406906
when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	559.7088610260154
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	468.17592479909064
my temper i dare not vouch for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	455.41862228582806
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	151.36382977135403
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	786.7168493726464
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	445.18108286454225
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was."	247.73703736947905
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "oh!	324.536530798602
my dear jane, mr collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	392.41859788655375
i write rather slowly."	83.8737803994488
again she read on.	169.26278782111729
the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	719.4910747859974
she knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	209.91289372167444
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	164.69498516009088
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	780.2721622089875
"so much the better.	64.01039523835736
said miss bingley; "will she be as tall as i am?"	284.9964576076901
they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	538.1145266959
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	388.8468291264684
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	138.47627664435112
"her not objecting, does not justify him.	227.25505850468954
&c."	40.89100765879862
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	699.3580082744056
cried bingley.	58.3637120677373
he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	363.81851962230337
seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.	507.022714373935
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	630.5091594883228
i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	254.11240060334646
"oh!	7.596391247223825
but you know married women have never much time for writing.	399.3089614941989
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	219.3533937883593
"is it possible!"	72.70163815841383
you do not know what i suffer."	75.20026132341067
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	136.97755531507468
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.	807.9017809114908
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	160.192940034331
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	601.5828053512583
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	260.50143835900786
her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	533.0515422630309
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.	282.9502802277559
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	418.60578799798003
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"	377.5309709196986
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	424.1608090745012
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him."	414.51736488558873
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	606.7907646261118
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	310.4153119926087
she could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	615.9025945262829
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, "in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	645.9896469455763
"your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet."	146.41909872017965
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	346.18667783364657
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	460.1552036846512
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	428.29949779928967
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	307.28072174649355
she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	242.2984642692979
"good heavens!"	56.1505422902094
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.	249.44945543402926
my affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."	449.23693903643033
i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's regard."	220.40579781889585
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	675.5893340804928
i could hardly keep my countenance.	156.66069942675205
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	111.18285876687806
you must and shall be married by a special licence.	300.9108572499911
"my dear, you flatter me.	61.0983771709642
elizabeth was forced to go.	59.78491286508388
well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	450.3829733760338
and then we were so merry all the way home!	308.64378799971183
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	333.8376183107544
chapter x.	49.077036267764335
and for this we are to be thankful.	255.3329882298368
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	538.0556712718732
but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	723.9222279698819
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	386.3272527304184
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.	642.620063497134
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	508.0856005477896
what is the matter?"	87.84403817727538
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	778.762335345215
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself."	288.7351796255052
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."	193.94646681943067
our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great.	253.1755727990279
"but you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."	385.68445927148605
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."	317.6911071713284
but it ended in nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	274.6528839724997
if there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	644.9673833598815
at such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	435.3534641628293
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	337.70600406893186
she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	208.5370339606699
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better.	690.081615050939
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.	647.5736338203741
"when i consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that i might have prevented it!--i who knew what he was.	340.656396679387
"i will make no promise of the kind."	119.56624009110867
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."	525.0759867950242
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	197.25867472715797
but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	335.79896873397195
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	483.7786771393673
"i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife.	80.14206987444092
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.	785.8658750991247
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.	635.0865857267329
chapter vi.	61.44207151475285
he knows where we live.	182.42105488507687
"colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	527.86220958268
but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."	371.6355000735847
* * * * * transcriber's note: spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book.	378.8949306913313
she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	337.0643739607437
poor little lizzy!	140.39927841386503
it was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	213.5521138418761
let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	435.4075176605406
lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball."	372.96684378745596
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	401.57149025116706
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	654.5160795682224
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	734.9660980985001
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	238.29402402690468
who are your uncles and aunts?	321.6501274133318
"my dear niece, "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you.	436.9742602201142
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.	938.0059250967411
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	608.7922293580035
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	656.0984099695706
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	384.8262338907095
has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	376.8293075199733
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."	587.4086056809073
"i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news.	177.44482491513014
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	502.1484399749561
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	339.00273493299494
she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to kitty, "come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	551.474121955696
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."	305.0048737309279
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.	482.0487041261099
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	460.24816590786713
if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him.	304.8642684679264
they have some of the finest woods in the country."	162.96930960834538
the lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	287.7328037537508
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	578.1173891037986
"yes, very handsome."	44.4789914689819
did she call to refuse her consent?"	279.22268169074863
till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him."	307.9425536609196
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	650.6082825148405
this he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	511.5303391630737
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.	331.8250106073269
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	691.2184747584595
are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"	349.82137354853694
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity."	241.85662862707784
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	434.8959025964503
chapter vii.	49.077036267764335
it is too long ago.	90.0356816518441
they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.	582.9017001132493
"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	158.9169686163924
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	154.01690594558616
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.	486.38789728847473
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	735.902637900758
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	178.14992219991987
and so extremely accomplished for her age!	246.8084214692115
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner.	200.3051971854714
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	580.7546179767493
there is nothing he would not do for her."	115.22985030560449
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	604.4153045196838
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"	213.09456878236367
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	138.2437801781919
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	519.857609260328
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	476.1897885563383
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	330.9203161431238
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	738.6520835557503
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	731.3850711230583
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	199.1659076140458
such very superior dancing is not often seen.	376.3352577187437
i am not romantic you know.	74.1398642815528
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.	859.7372093347875
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	692.3786283037819
there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.	679.2880885765777
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.	480.73179066066336
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.	418.97464283717835
elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	528.1146788122694
but it is all, all too late now."	124.56930910073154
"but you will know it, when i have told you what happened the very next day."	240.65234927525498
i know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	607.953450562593
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	499.86329969505675
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	434.8423047469565
this will never do."	88.34783548224206
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?	603.6671014127157
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	519.2904492608697
end of the second volume.	253.05722920400137
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	362.4326184450145
you take delight in vexing me.	181.11821298702023
mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	413.3474203412145
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	432.8396411117929
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	681.5037864543519
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.	348.8975804887223
you were not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	263.8287899698147
but georgiana would not join her.	151.78968963232543
bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.	606.3668565543471
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	657.7670345207744
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	852.7373427465526
"you are mistaken.	31.798777387019687
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	757.4764614165356
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	252.76499467078656
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	561.3842383510679
for, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	696.143685806234
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me."	506.02385739478325
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	127.12339883278354
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	719.4023282425071
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?"	638.0451514808933
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	252.4832192062511
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	364.4923190404493
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	598.5680186645054
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i particularly begged him to do.	499.41824147930356
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	573.8365666308334
"you are severe on us."	58.66180269443901
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	421.569313762003
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	617.5561425185793
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	447.93055783617643
but do not imagine that he is always here so often.	266.9618263492272
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew.	171.08253897337727
and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	281.4460141299663
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	451.57952589805086
your's, &c."	54.272742713256605
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention.	321.098562555928
well, much good may it do them!	298.82987678660714
those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	686.594235475369
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."	855.4482424588919
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	697.1852653952529
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	701.0703090049291
i knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	583.6432223359233
your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."	428.5931281665758
till i was in kent, and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself.	544.9080884946314
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."	428.5664923819021
"if one could but go to brighton!"	115.7919814076781
"is that his design in settling here?"	190.83794091486354
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.	214.27109596451191
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	799.6837206846471
said she.	40.23958881291898
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	872.4821382216564
but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	493.5469326723305
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	779.6249743231064
they shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	730.3097447260601
mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	839.2251456564858
things are settled so oddly."	216.31577087418233
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	354.57745903680546
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just tolerable."	357.71764280894894
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	209.3588809130867
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	473.74463000666276
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	833.8425372124112
"yes, very well.	34.9953022324389
i am afraid you will be angry."	62.01816132558969
chapter xi.	49.077036267764335
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, "you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right.	830.9753331778788
"when my eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	180.89004703910794
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."	184.14751933274408
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.	963.9848912997411
jane now came up.	150.990143787494
their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	658.3956821190266
he comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	495.2693967541311
he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	284.2519445361956
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	515.4984455859317
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham.	550.5106200650305
lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	493.6744720760211
and poor mr darcy!	109.71284244509556
this cannot be!	83.83021361329376
the party did not supply much conversation.	238.55168502588162
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	277.45417470670424
after abusing you so abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."	544.8298047641715
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."	404.0473927171364
i shall be back by dinner."	86.7434334216743
"and men take care that they should."	122.47031578378798
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."	298.64433398237645
this letter is from mr collins."	128.8905092796079
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.	507.1390940545878
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	232.3511995313298
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."	147.88762353049503
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."	353.8230961608617
it cannot be concealed from any one.	158.55315442222087
"an easy distance do you call it?	200.21645118776868
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	645.7976932134611
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham.	563.8452402116676
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of me.	260.1032446154557
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand."	340.8012402416853
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	1007.6886433366248
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	281.5948690155841
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!	352.10289221419583
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	691.4042568344911
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	330.61729871589705
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	729.9338026012415
there can be no occasion for your going so soon.	214.98305796883068
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, "my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	566.6406369370637
if i could but see you as happy!	263.2002418395487
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	666.377379746558
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	353.6473067606173
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	283.9943890153081
invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square.	622.5484681437594
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	312.24761650451006
she cried.	29.497010214990077
yes--i understand you perfectly."	131.9524522271565
mr bennet protested against any description of finery.	265.46526950730646
"and how impossible in others!"	107.12923392572856
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	194.24711151791357
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.	526.9033352417388
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.	630.250284281445
five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	525.3810300985091
"neglect!	57.35399169648249
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	150.8544279946041
chapter xiv.	61.44207151475285
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	385.17312183132384
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter.	123.21709478499461
my father and mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him.	203.17783828456123
he was very fond of them."	53.84644380970022
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."	245.94566198713736
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."	326.4468742159707
and in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	630.6746796122497
i am impatient to see him."	54.20614224122626
"very well.	25.94136797074033
you have employed your time much better.	169.94067665665497
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	570.9920371677263
vol.	63.468596081134955
"and then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	398.72090474471025
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself.	439.25342548289376
but of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	742.4759067066713
never, even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings.	981.5511104158038
in truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	637.9883066553148
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	371.9251058097377
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	654.9534726359548
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.	640.7294323733671
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	236.0595716808651
miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	452.1198809732837
a person may be proud without being vain.	323.3453593868061
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	156.1898872763526
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	540.7318566078135
we acted with the best intentions."	181.80973526118467
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties.	1011.2971474850195
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst's gown----" here she was interrupted again.	296.90234896226275
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	119.42081318942772
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	658.2797606873985
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."	660.2780134422495
here comes hill.	162.54447672008763
for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	355.8693423623584
after an affectionate parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown.	652.8513954336121
and though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	440.0948179697881
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	372.1207608392586
he had never before supposed that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	511.02200303670185
letters of business too!	273.54908273694514
pray forgive me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from p.	546.401266186126
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	316.5014705311082
its completion depended on others.	236.25621245154707
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	309.15831072165145
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	404.33143352916346
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	806.8197191845471
he is so excessively handsome!	125.37180564822927
"what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way?	172.4010675042271
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	743.1575766557733
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.	340.47899105652704
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	485.482477182806
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children.	542.7130925908267
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.	216.97821352387024
while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	512.0544975360158
she is not such a simpleton.	131.04540270227682
"you have.	32.50595712127452
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	467.3242581225598
they found mr bennet still up.	200.59760770718853
every thing nourishes what is strong already.	281.297401792804
"you are joking, lizzy.	73.10215369211984
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs bennet instantly answered, "oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	381.2297255556221
"but you--how are you?"	86.16770567958756
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by wickham.	521.1936374316326
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	717.6347539623113
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	469.84297317778527
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	446.8210805794324
they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	654.66619609978
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	798.7121899474082
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	425.14106245494895
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.	491.07337690241945
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	380.66571201627283
at last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance.	490.95612999484763
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	501.62546437638866
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	654.6878446760381
not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley.	504.4171226205581
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	231.6761853084039
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	73.09904476396112
he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	373.61972240759127
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	389.958133011791
it is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."	383.43848050242536
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy, "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	328.827970455254
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	530.7313069155508
in society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	415.15291966921825
yours ever, "caroline bingley."	242.5625006702713
at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."	429.4456904068623
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia, assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn.	752.0072870121062
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	365.444535603232
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	743.7936823737028
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road."	384.113002481837
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	629.792514094762
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	113.98312725591218
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."	527.7392152583471
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "in vain have i struggled.	697.3261210768196
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	260.2817680631421
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	751.8202561698814
no principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy.	320.4108875839659
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	438.21349161035613
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	646.0604704472395
the garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	703.2348281561498
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	822.3829400603435
and with no one to speak to, of what i felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	615.1579433359689
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	632.48835490092
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.	582.0360106585732
"my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	415.7155981292268
two obstacles of the five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	738.4868580503866
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	336.28600827522155
all were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	945.378063604019
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	236.63028348152096
she is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will make her know it."	293.8041718351184
"true.	39.09189937525261
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him."	201.07330535713754
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	418.157673294765
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has not sixpence of his own.	551.9656024979304
they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	667.2376749437201
you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	447.52548772233416
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections.	167.65844286349542
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	283.39774479399205
i hate such false friends.	141.99201707558777
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	766.670226822403
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	696.720374163708
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	185.56347589992475
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	289.042443505176
jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	398.19893937783905
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	320.3089514976802
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	411.9343432287308
it mortifies me.	67.6723681521626
there is nothing else to be done.	98.04965623043488
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	531.3361150789256
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you.	272.8542835828506
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.	318.32140998793676
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	774.7926732686865
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	582.8125689160088
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	239.43477433302527
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	391.601944492461
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	561.4792654063947
yes, miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	560.2676142982601
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	137.56471248511127
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	159.62907752381733
i only hope they may have half my good luck.	338.51217041014917
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	387.2960496177508
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."	356.17236410591306
kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	524.9746420381784
"i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design," said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	374.1237217608322
but i dare not hope it.	91.11911955416595
but your family owe me nothing.	179.1619764019054
of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	619.293967111763
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	396.6838819436678
to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	266.31486503205554
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	806.6241210615108
"i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family."	152.52220258169422
"yes, sir, i know i am.	93.15457582979295
could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected.	447.62800121221443
every thing being settled between them, mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	479.656629263709
she practises very constantly."	92.34190022594457
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!	468.64072404859206
"my dear jane!"	33.83121648198509
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ("the foundation" or pglaf), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg-tm electronic works.	392.9295357696772
mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	243.25571883121947
that he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!	432.8011085058537
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	437.45512280176814
at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	252.06481269892532
she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself.	638.6849595986552
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	603.9225608303504
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	776.8178998136245
mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library.	317.68853092726147
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	139.4965199161583
"write to me very often, my dear."	159.4707427895312
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	650.4092536807567
but your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	519.7394817169078
he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	357.360449621972
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley.	316.1614938789445
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried elizabeth.	181.59193780750638
"i have no right to give my opinion," said wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise.	248.75279423405587
intending to trace their route.	357.64724023401396
they are wanted in the farm, mr bennet, are not they?"	226.56148948554656
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning.	601.7988794588837
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	506.2249545152966
this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	442.6445165860941
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	151.68679805112478
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with him, if i were you."	136.96835297028474
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	532.688966778262
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	511.6720375086334
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	322.5940978075083
"exceed their income!	129.95822316938023
"oh!	7.596391247223825
thought elizabeth.	85.15154629844115
mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	272.43880056592013
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	681.6081087441888
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	198.95309805679645
"and this is your real opinion!	125.5509424721997
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	306.9843226643501
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do."	409.60793160674456
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."	364.14679596403147
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?	771.2822044970304
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	1000.8922759282916
but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	355.3039890812958
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	774.0608752151913
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	580.3309243226051
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	583.9915425318392
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"	315.8301074423559
she resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	532.1234026640169
and her neighbours at lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only set that down, as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	792.8290769402952
"you did!	49.34490392969853
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	649.8282024682236
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	210.47736984259194
a few weeks, he believed.	196.7436277322927
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.	276.4177081952624
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.	610.8247848236949
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted.	91.77953689109229
in 2001 , the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	534.7522417363494
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.	440.6776565642598
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	404.89995314471844
lord!	47.92677388112846
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	570.1418110014665
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.	211.15360224643672
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley.	224.26993172763983
"indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!"	287.16075055981497
but he found, in reply to this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	611.4961433573854
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.	685.5400741909602
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long.	242.7436275794381
but let me advise you to think better of it.	177.329731292855
she answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, "my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	445.9966477606774
you do not look well.	88.42439021544263
she will be taken good care of.	163.42150008685292
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	357.4928244817329
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	886.238868952728
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips's manners and politeness.	428.15491642822434
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	399.3271125387831
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."	438.85152079131626
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.	120.11670740595024
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, "if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."	656.02117803644
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.	572.6160138358083
"you have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	354.81663227434814
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.	819.3673644824994
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."	532.1246256506562
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	562.7578457145571
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	195.45949531819434
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former.	386.67017006194436
"dearest jane!	77.6740449492181
jane was not happy.	101.95211867923227
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	101.48210708016397
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	230.5816249801757
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	678.9936942093035
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	715.5231892121687
her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	592.8490590913394
but that is nothing to us.	104.48170156791646
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."	329.035868043468
we had better not mention it.	135.9973663331745
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	263.90481348462146
"yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	215.89394992740586
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	249.3661518111314
mr bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.	284.0316593442132
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country.	522.2814201134555
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	386.7106404257607
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	571.3333751528619
"you began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas.	261.73485903027466
i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing."	763.0637740841515
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."	362.3322604579256
lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	796.5877288925733
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls.	478.3866501590437
two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	608.0651142826675
had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	666.4098172841731
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	461.386274966681
jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman."	384.70440628140096
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	269.6434628892022
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	311.13147881310607
it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us.	280.4738291397316
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!"	243.76193989190205
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	530.739065251001
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	377.8832556953647
what news?	65.79969689421125
the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	546.5207264369334
chapter i.	49.08112948229592
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	275.12377087866327
if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."	354.9358471375714
"you observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."	186.81386999577944
"my dearest sister, now be be serious.	199.26291821581552
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	797.4779013970549
you know not what you are about."	121.6029069622345
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	792.5262867757174
"but so we all do.	93.36439432306486
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness."	227.03546194601756
not that i think charlotte so very plain--but then she is our particular friend."	353.6431128134
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	429.3903276260627
"good gracious!"	34.47070868973328
"a little."	28.00789739335139
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	279.17938069424036
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"	505.98157760208704
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	471.79760401311825
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	573.0925546500146
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself."	267.587993221619
mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	332.02557451688926
"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	356.4559853169967
you dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."	753.6441517985406
who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	630.887007452363
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	283.2181338850496
now what have you to say?"	180.29362843480047
i thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town.	355.6145103868369
if he fears me, why come hither?	301.16897183497287
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	629.2209903217905
i have no such injuries to resent.	158.43480220679882

her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.	434.3910251437955
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	477.1217341213701
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	507.6791573214795
she saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	582.2213885155405
good heaven!	80.71004184977531
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	464.24471588737094
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	516.2077740129156
a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone.	352.91851971031514
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable.	363.4310700762536
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	585.8415133866582
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	739.6819125217194
and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?	572.0602785047723
"oh!	7.596391247223825
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	612.7403426813526
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	505.98595475613314
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them.	465.5274243253826
and what sort of table do they keep?	246.8526905463228
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.	638.0825469477151
but i must write no more.	98.60209668866125
she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then observed, "your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	655.3484213975378
"i do not know.	22.555478497556436
i am sure you will be very comfortable there.	94.30918879952324
oh!	14.346523268075027
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley.	266.40069089103514
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	592.346128266129
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	83.81517698220185
a most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	307.21634618819917
he was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	607.0326605122864
'lady catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	522.9046287430743
people do not die of little trifling colds.	468.4819167796315
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	752.6475457152812
we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	522.3047804395964
she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!	715.3533223452552
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."	764.4571419097119
the venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	592.8789299711304
you must contrive to send somebody.	194.20833896865767
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	549.3618719920613
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.	686.8458348140163
"it must have been his sister's doing.	133.18735146486324
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	353.9439277946401
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	282.65203881741996
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	551.9471536839131
are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	421.65979875558935
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	199.29896106946597
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?"	161.87847639484167
i can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, i have seen nothing of it."	337.5019770639583
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	676.7112597683033
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	597.0439979121264
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	182.1595813577865
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	580.335456659988
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	523.1320658458546
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?"	479.8656247966924
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	262.4183196840178
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	522.4911367582271

consider mr collins's respectability, and charlotte's prudent, steady character.	446.4812445630384
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more than i ever look into."	426.95928807629184
his belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	656.558708844326
"what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy?"--said jane as she finished it.	265.7567001906939
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	438.19226110305004
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	196.004781086595
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	597.1578804313924
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	114.91276874109727
but, lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or jane at most.	396.9609098066989
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street.	763.9069968794217
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	448.9276564629005
"how despicably have i acted!"	127.01146714958304
painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	563.8307849451775
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	209.6658307256461
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?	515.1936329518767
i have by no means done.	95.15601575141112
unfeeling, selfish girl!	258.59782431338476

as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	427.45992669971184
dear, dear lizzy.	124.37185164351096
it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	519.0688417585187
now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"	403.6759127038961
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	167.9362274891366
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	304.56724974104594
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	775.4840835649695
i should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	214.16014800316063
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins, and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	231.82704494664637
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	696.8546228018382
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.	386.4278473758337
she was ashamed to think how much.	124.73477156508766
"yours, &c."	46.207043373628466
i did not wink at you."	72.66055455013172
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november 18 th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	915.7956871379066
"wickham so very bad!	150.30149535530256
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army," she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	430.9619414187955
but what does he say of the living?"	208.32896893269026
"my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?"	263.71207133057965
mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, mr wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	631.0354137774555
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say.	309.9191920843415
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	515.6856590191413
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	774.5324002889929
when all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.	711.8775934112841
she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade.	551.9300935862722
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.	547.7087463148474
oh!	14.346523268075027
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	774.6026707054745
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	223.85944894451322
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	262.5670371469331
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."	328.3872134674176
"good gracious!	36.37999570532283
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	533.0355951371687
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy.	483.3648065184342
elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	413.38556492082836
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	179.65466621175102
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	652.6059319624902
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	246.38730726172182
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	732.5181434559564
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."	272.34944449596156
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	776.1734387876104
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	412.853655304708
well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	518.0567017625629
oh!	14.346523268075027
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them, was expressed towards the two eldest.	699.8615615461865
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	281.48025979608695
by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	606.2761039323121
jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	405.33575973098533
let her go then.	146.57993314555873
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back.	470.6389188331948
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give.	530.9174926637374
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.	547.8103244148717
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	334.3344716971602
this was one point, with regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	550.100691552913
this was invitation enough.	94.3350301972665
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	105.34286170324016
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."	261.78382395007355
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	495.1259499112006
he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	501.5659569892914
but gracious me!	81.35952252339504
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	458.5217017907515
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	698.5630522683947
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	695.8799017606892
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	850.2581758243587
pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."	734.9871709961868
elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	122.49218596679017
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	669.9636504648663
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	213.70005743429928
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was."	242.17364964884695
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	397.61088673731297
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	132.03237286724783
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	233.73476860671386
good gracious!	80.7258065266841
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due."	459.107447574026
i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, i am thus rejected.	527.1523111811492
it must be an amusing study."	104.48312747671716
it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	659.3152632827821
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	490.25682699229543
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	718.4303624946039
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	553.6420382890086
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no longer.	873.0571631441672
those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.	769.0302098601292
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	890.5357011035617
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	376.7568131324339
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	701.8997638088515
oh, that i knew how it was!"	156.18165879844912
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.	472.3498329159311
they were hopeless of remedy.	143.39078882039524
and to be kept back on such a motive!--i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."	379.750980726693
had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."	572.4890784240574
"that it ought not to be attempted.	148.22009164195194
she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.	251.43471840998913
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	372.9574134567788
and she rose as she spoke.	188.38646321584721
"no; but it must be done soon."	99.03295996553935
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine.	671.3060076416914
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	222.61396669094842
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	456.9297513981893
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	512.948803398386
i often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	514.1949066338093
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done.	321.15094263865893
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	360.9427967501339
you wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	510.8107104309763
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	463.6126544621694
"and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london!	478.5765577517403
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	325.3694069355692
i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family."	511.6861471808381
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	308.75341247200186
"she is a great deal too ill to be moved.	168.78805456766113
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	602.7852763538997
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	231.6102850652509
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	603.0617545105856
lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!	483.92913717614584
1.f.3.	44.15539294892887
about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate; and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	980.6049201224091
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i demand it of your justice.	611.954839167895
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.	445.66179259666916
mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	464.625708159803
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	418.728632880558
"that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."	312.5820005032198
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	426.87732073788965
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address.	605.4643301886325
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	520.5140296882595
she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.	600.1786084577701
as for their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	488.08152837191346
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	568.3821306709826
said she.	40.23958881291898
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"	228.82181204669408
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that.	282.8273698487175
her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	170.58911150051907
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter.	404.7644256465226
her reflections were in general satisfactory.	244.59807504772155
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	314.2150856631649
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	511.59664831431786
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."	456.66092689218397
the express was sent off directly.	165.73230113770035
chapter vii.	49.077036267764335
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	611.5106129313424
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	240.98964400254744
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	116.88307020526267
it was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	279.864170594353
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them.	229.65992685703395
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	226.44023724039428
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	692.0220808783235
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.	542.3798294387345
they will never be distressed for money.	230.64423274668346
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	184.3636974287141
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	467.6317522979997
chapter x.	49.077036267764335
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	425.9655933035473
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	283.91637228739773
"certainly.	40.3827867623985
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear.	681.3689604594537
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	871.6698482814464
and, above all things, keep mr bennet from fighting.	435.2563902172169
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an argument, and want to silence this."	249.18666561109822
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	517.7978176848661
well!	54.537416503771546
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	313.44978552893707
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"	342.5917881688193
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i am the youngest, i'm the tallest."	319.92897528192265
1.f.4.	44.15539294892887
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	188.27210425000683
you know my sentiments."	72.7954436299093
"oh!	7.596391247223825
who could have done less for her?	302.2057438353266
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."	390.65816698694033
it originated in mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	449.6198657863161
here, sarah, come to miss bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	676.5293333781515
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's.	505.25877150826335
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	551.5071423534308
the officer was the very mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	640.8197513556476
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity.	159.56351598648075
we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	400.99168770735145
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	703.9547805963076
"and may i ask?"	61.32314017460081
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."	183.3870957971029
"oh!	7.596391247223825
they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	296.00291674661236
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	519.1467930905721
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth, dovedale, or the peak.	783.6743764190392
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character."	173.50901146009028
"your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.	282.9735533902627
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	192.12574770029508
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	285.25098690169136
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	568.4586978828349
"but what is to be done about pemberley?"	114.14978595017415
"it is wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	411.00701662657167
"and have you heard from him often?"	121.85579583022533
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	576.1166608543987
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	653.9237103563468
i certainly have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	335.69958046894703
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	588.251858446821
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well."	444.47001103931365
"i did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."	551.5447580472851
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do.	331.54206804143416
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.	126.5011741000478
the rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	603.0809761414481
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	793.9750355953388
and if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	531.9960730756429
"perfectly so--i thank you."	93.66748035066152
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	763.3732156314385
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.	456.50326771407254
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states.	486.972599334906
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	160.48334133456476
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head quarters.	687.6815284127389
as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	403.545348017221
it is every way horrible!"	102.43140806510716
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.	604.9967581900805
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	779.3116843703407
"of what are you talking?"	109.64212856256113
what is to become of us!	165.62259479354518
"who do you mean, my dear?	139.35436232061267
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	213.84923612789936
those who chose to be idle, certainly might."	267.9846707441614
but no one can throw any blame on them.	181.83817331004255
with a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	711.2259906847389
at that moment, she cared for no other.	241.75921650304082
from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	879.3566765559056
but now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	350.1730301029458
darcy said nothing at all.	105.9275083031785
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	300.5072212442881
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	729.7842925250682
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	642.4429869013445
let me hear what it is."	108.75242963269137
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	223.64626484220804
only think!	102.00147632189535
you must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what i say.	388.10903170406243
"i have said no such thing.	73.77393123409738
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	743.0798681609713
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	1042.8205273255232
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner.	254.28106769015076
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	613.7444887485384
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	638.9746874277233
no, no, you shall not deceive me.	177.05465480483124
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there.	463.6965821911551
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	467.60041394480135
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	219.03712813730453
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.	585.3837288166025
i was never more annoyed!	107.91390909591165
"that is a failing indeed!"--cried elizabeth.	143.42108429901924
"would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	533.2536324802023

too much, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject?	688.1032761959776
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	277.0598997316615
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks.	561.2873689920892
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining in, observed, "yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her.	481.534774058753
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	146.85323903715584
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to mr collins!	605.8055074842388
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	626.7313826179113
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	421.19209487716375
"what do you mean?"	34.56401085761599
does your charge give you much trouble?	418.7297800505123
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	878.038112608612
it amazes me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.	461.8464172220478
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.	527.6408339960454
i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	223.6277377122304
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	161.34173224976308
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	611.0868248665081
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame.	359.2957319020011
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	102.60195469543818
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins instead!	447.449545124421
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance.	554.9150686606824
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.	735.36693658386
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it."	446.34913059754024
it had better have happened to you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	452.075169731251
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	306.1168083747121
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."	143.33388614576555
mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	537.7150697456242
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet.	157.08543120960468
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	407.52587666936455
nor was darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	540.0763917257835
said her mother.	65.52024723949623
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.	601.1668573191268
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	730.3172046377002
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	367.89647416424793
we shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	320.97213732161975
"having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	749.9453233187176
"i will not be interrupted.	64.72132801698604
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."	520.1180360969449
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield, and she blushed as she answered, "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.	549.0744791965051
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan."	273.2682100438716
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	481.94525746484635
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	786.5194821806892
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.	834.8089632000089
he owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	531.481945969432
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	597.0928306359831
but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley, and her being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	864.7113090111569
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	687.0308162950357
after a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	439.23695435449224
chapter xv.	49.077036267764335
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	185.5647715074222
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	315.5642438267178
she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.	354.1102288841592
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	505.55380784640204
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him."	451.26949447629414
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	324.15039256306926
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."	413.41234630639593
"true," said mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."	295.48762736360527
she looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	341.2582705170302
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	556.5067949243028
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	201.61285155667204
"yes, or i will never see her again."	121.78731172903447
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	203.00161612417614
she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	644.2199903354739
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	346.8276946645084
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	518.9727581882074
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	285.3160031176365
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	144.18575227230608
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	300.41003197751405
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	170.86155172116736
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	229.11526904482835
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.	319.25310234643314
"i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."	241.5801777208136
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	366.0665534557327
one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	941.8232038812589
but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."	258.19159021700784
in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	469.9736716384844
chapter xvi.	61.44207151475285
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	844.8790049119442
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	721.3456450757969
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	496.1976169686156
i know you will contrive it all."	90.26486827011945
their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	623.1663597985731
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	760.5148053855647
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!	188.13179591361066
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	760.8003140085771
i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	544.6396944413437
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?	481.9225494010772
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	178.16937932777577
and then when we came away it was such fun!	327.852531673361
say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	453.7298977564366
have you heard from my uncle?"	169.39484166915958
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."	447.5128006511925
not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	514.6002106355088
with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord!	804.0038441818592
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	121.88976067529437
'ah!	127.74212987734974
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	568.403850355307
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	615.9926289432918

"no, lizzy, that is what i do not choose.	128.68901717872228
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	549.9419893871984
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	187.7673053987825
mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	626.548005849537
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.	279.45967115530664
"there can be no doubt of that.	120.93132123479035
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	418.82604718321903
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	570.2788600529137
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	282.48613066353823
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	497.4757276390546
chapter iii.	46.489774947193354
"my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza," said charlotte.	311.56248929807856
"really, mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.	257.868642048
dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--"there, mrs bennet."--my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england.	870.2218599945891
on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	288.4907589695153
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	696.8888656124112
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	249.74317365102104
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	522.0833628455629
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	486.58555789185095
chapter xvii.	61.44207151475285
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	322.5430086986946
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	319.81423193332364
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	164.13586092398458
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	648.8238471152048
if there were but such another man for you!"	251.99030369787013
mrs bennet's best comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer.	278.3569333368759
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.	680.2045379560279
while in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!	737.1250898437909
but will they make you happy?"	161.71965885047553
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	654.4840509178005
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	608.4177006637867
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	255.07530422740868
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	596.2390582115918
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	214.59961239695681
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	287.9459368791902
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	714.0132539309103
her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	558.6649523972449
in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind."	235.4096448502348
this cannot be!--engaged to mr darcy!	180.9519595318291
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	108.6507178450089
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	556.8908783565844
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	686.7014221300774
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	279.1144042412676
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	570.9649112690685
he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning.	557.792865880925
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which she had refused to give.	802.180746790969
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."	345.1188872421788
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.	634.6618430314679
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	387.7297061102068
teaze him--laugh at him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	361.03916504221814
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."	635.8896312118183
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.	246.08313896065374
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	546.2839013500311
i want to talk very seriously.	180.0961927597526
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	389.3400287760623
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	528.2168226722922
will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him.	493.2362738818915
perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was not like ease.	690.5836100951916
"i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield.	263.2124541288237
they must all go to brighton.	143.9708929602146
thank heaven!	103.22495356997929
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr bennet coolly observed, "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	599.3816600514236
and what do you think she said besides?	193.06297930147807
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	157.00445010822494
respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.	877.805505456165
such a charming man!--so handsome!	228.587140703832
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in her.	376.0617648371716
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	679.4517924960763
but if you are really innocent and ignorant, i must be more explicit.	329.0666460885776
brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	634.5810899569915
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy.	221.92274090446114
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	646.3623958834321
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	103.65515515517704
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	507.13073388128475
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.	443.5840328295261
when mrs bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	605.6379789160577
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	129.52347744197823
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	728.0450924872702
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	623.9983815542117
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever i saw.	193.4389807415912
she will not be able to help calling."	97.15964444105985
we were married, you know, at st clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	447.8206385380822
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	584.321967820493
chapter xiii.	61.44207151475285
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	363.53924371750526
these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	610.2341835692159
she approached, and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.	587.7188193145287

in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."	312.76974596787267
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	203.67900126158915
it was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	264.3433748094509
how you must have hated me after that evening?"	249.68669393919296
her answer was warmly in his favour.	237.14733053684876
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	592.82227706332
"i know them a little.	84.13153790879514
they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	594.0205077017706
what will you think of my vanity?	268.7438458992506
"ah!"	36.38276424365114
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted."	204.27937974506932
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	320.0610762361675
he took the hint, and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "that will do extremely well, child.	490.6078620817753

you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	297.5736712839018
and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and mrs long.	386.35626502290864
about ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	703.34053357727
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said elizabeth.	131.76767686598146
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	59.905323803288404
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	630.0902860739707
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	279.34010255425204
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."	374.7025767152894
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn would come in the evening.	561.6012059498195
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	376.06828858901036
if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	281.567623491338
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out.	718.7257438941688
mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	419.0358135595931
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	505.550727055534
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!	422.77936575742393
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	426.5010438708076
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."	275.9160519215129
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	126.4752893808513
he has also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."	671.8525887883588
"mr darcy!"	26.813500840133806
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy.	140.9916921944702
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	302.1394428681614
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	591.7733850488021
"not the slightest.	95.24445104969882
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	393.71134390260073
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them, at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	685.2720573694362
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	616.8239891523878
i wonder what he can be doing there."	177.71606570199688
i congratulate her.	53.788672926307584
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	689.9498115355904
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	127.2916996233014
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	738.4777305252289
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	354.6037749148352
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	593.433011033903
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	592.8091180744915
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	307.4806836243465
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent.	661.0024025319694
for god's sake, say no more of his partners.	356.64376453501785
"we can all plague and punish one another.	229.53068171919915
no."	26.453580453620557
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	310.71163527476756
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	503.9701872877948
egerton, military library, whitehall.	235.7733502160271
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before.	473.93535825846993
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."	279.59566708207836
it is useless to talk of it."	67.43207270962769
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	591.7087907129131
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!	662.5125588436316
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london.	452.65571420114907
"can you deny that you have done it?"	138.11837003597543
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	737.0547217938832
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance."	139.40495346958758
but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	186.9050498205061
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	923.4136277581965
he danced only four dances!	144.38479895375045
i never was.	51.58845449242825
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."	285.6915476956846
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	579.3117327812304
they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for mr darcy.	635.1060682864438
yes, yes.	81.32813860615661
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u.s.	415.1792894343533
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	237.38256116532574
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	794.3575048244531
if i have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.	643.0633269985976
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	303.5928315626072
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	523.5223059792871
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	308.4780352525136
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together.	691.0221349335083
you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner.	445.8729031392552
i hope he will overlook it.	101.94893669760421
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it.	99.90183527823508
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	479.61565403897066
"let me be rightly understood.	159.42952841833394
the possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	331.6771274471462
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday.	573.4309837246359
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	408.78640377692085
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	518.9205860481211
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	111.17308390562641
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to scotland."	398.80003346193286
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	688.2386696001082

"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	140.15162577975784
at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends--whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."	696.437900082732
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s regiment."	181.72400986590281
my dear, dear lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	244.63523598811975
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	436.45464854971823
"never, sir."	67.83494514873756
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	252.2360538231099
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	259.40078080918016
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	476.48152333010137
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."	578.169937827925
stay, stay, i will go myself.	308.383733723447
mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	437.0491550712824
chapter xx.	87.2378589933409
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	392.04055753987456
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	755.7534895391273
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	320.16673246019434
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	247.2965809819545
she had been unwilling to mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.	363.3517266176148
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	463.2993781771684
he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	379.2392011468568
but do not be cast down.	134.82936426826936
"she is my youngest girl but one.	161.93046972455355
send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	514.8108964972956
wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	604.1478117451735
how are you all?"	102.51970281211685
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	274.3553263833781
it must be my uncle's doings!	185.38853819709016
what could she mean by it?	181.07484725868176
a clear ten thousand per annum.	287.3941920451351
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	503.4471328282568
oh, no."	53.75289781544388
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham.	878.2727354254718
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	490.1106728462393
what did colonel forster say?	187.28384823023416
so much the man of fashion!	245.0819326841363
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	647.1822029283087
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	115.50377936422534
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country.	650.875653704109
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.	817.1011709531559
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them.	602.8984777385906
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	467.5046629456519
though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	658.1237342258388
she certainly did not hate him.	152.24775801782866
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	642.384623899544
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	677.1813203006151
they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."	487.50702091539387
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	171.66758756218485
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.	278.4955653941639
there was no arguing upon such a project.	231.14372072599767
kitty and me were to spend the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, mrs forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	777.8277355085764
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	629.8366437916079
"oh!	7.596391247223825
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	484.2711955084342
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	292.0525673340478
next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	689.122334382237
no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.	586.1639031544435
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.	552.6937135161559
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	632.1972970109215
in that case he would return no more.	209.10106204836106
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself.	748.9811275498797
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."	622.0290907339656
mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley never stirs without him."	583.669557155695
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure.	117.92965525705974
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."--and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins."	428.66028386589636
he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.	494.4306706231534
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	575.2377717835911
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy?"	108.4134448447283
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at present i have not room to do them justice."	429.89748677837696
i have not the smallest hope.	78.00409394759473
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence.	687.4837619932918
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	565.5342600249692
miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	230.90894544710838
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.	254.99520959684705
"you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	227.4686973593684
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	389.97473002014925
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i laugh.	380.86019297295417
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when he put his letter into her hand!	669.9648571669011
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."	310.2965952370376
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	314.2060794226341
kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	534.7615433113303
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	654.0253827147999
cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	405.0068091814964
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and i hope you will consent to be of the party.	323.6433820019498
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.	245.8213314148379
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	282.9953950232142
she then took a large house in edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	519.4665005306337
and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	630.6213334766884
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	498.0468362678786
he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	385.5232095424183
while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.	850.7732141837913
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	682.8925730658866
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	221.00342322120363
"this is not to be borne.	84.97462003888684
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	602.5109093229702
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	582.4099824169364
i saw them the night before last."	162.66181202053784
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	269.8453721819622
"a man who has once been refused!	176.50276699659693
no arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	871.5880162761935
let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	369.0349268112248
we have not met since the 26 th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield."	424.666522610934
i roused, and interested you, because i was so unlike them.	332.6099667703575
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	310.7518970417225
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	342.9831032236749
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	881.6840219837422
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield.	217.66779940595202
two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	573.1292552757704
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner.	314.98549228985337
his temptation is not adequate to the risk."	247.05375874929462
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	153.52077001268188
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	619.9971987173335
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	565.1258487608225
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	436.97925401593557
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f.	190.3301254862963
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."	326.4512748109149
my aunt told me so herself on saturday.	278.3369397628709
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	85.12693600313732
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	202.13610084688824
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr wickham and herself.	282.4372087557894
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	588.011629899217
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	714.387416535889
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	529.188638547547
"sure he will not leave london before he has found them.	273.5759915167826
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	305.01938040865684
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	231.68913108848744
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	621.5695524278811
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.	325.90835739732427
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	189.32870848286564
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.	377.9009979502113
"and do you like her?"	69.82535077291439
arguments are too much like disputes.	385.6762246344915
cried elizabeth.	24.868521698769708
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i despair.	722.3885869857611
forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."	343.1577524486947
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	442.90612814188523
my dear hill, have you heard the good news?	267.0894611694631
a great deal more passed at the other table.	223.65937763061785
mamma would like to go too of all things!	476.12410295732656
how are they even to be discovered?	295.1200924275939
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	545.2681255224658
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me!	286.11081310890694
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!	287.2753662490763
"i hope not so.	47.562064987201666
he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	386.2392435480612
it was over at last however.	145.98595471876766
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	182.09994718606612
is nothing due to me on that score?	410.85583969647644
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	597.903880528549
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	668.0369944804031
his coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	373.889960223303
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	424.4014526626883
but slyness seems the fashion.	178.56873369168105
they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	675.4291845280495
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	511.4710388879565
"we never had any governess."	103.60151836129361
they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities.	708.2931195572359
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they?	361.8785669119439
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	260.3794199289745
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth, "i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	372.9487371860249
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	464.89552963971244
oh!	14.346523268075027
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i am strongly inclined to hope the best.	711.842732374951
"undoubtedly.	51.03373212990952
what are we to do!"	145.8278034510119
mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	540.2815853936946
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you joy?"	406.4863796817703
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	213.04466548999892
women fancy admiration means more than it does."	321.77831360185303
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	435.80834867781925
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i assure you there are many amiable young women.	893.2029983619826
they are not married, nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	601.9249021595048
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	480.99095818646134
they met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	377.16547778079524
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	262.95302779262823
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	696.906718723452
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!	233.65969793082715
"mr darcy, you see, is the man!	157.55274501779388
her report was highly favourable.	215.48936748432197
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.	559.9010398716948
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and miss bingley.	238.5946560343371
said he, with a look of doubt.	128.88228633750177
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday.	405.81154020104833

we were always good friends; and now we are better."	260.15065164883293
chapter xvi.	61.44207151475285
"la!	57.35399169648249
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	423.5868218569746
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	818.446484111715
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	215.37722439570584
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."	193.0296790406833
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	130.1685541231217
without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	732.1686009245142
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my waking mr hurst."	408.67337909027447
nobody wants him to come.	243.60326466860133
he takes them now for people of fashion."	224.40524916191077
the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	872.7867142242992
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	429.2475608581871
"i should not mind any thing at all."	66.35871006037827
how he must have felt it!"	167.24012416645314
supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?	779.5742605290192
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days.	426.8660961592234
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	480.5917163001752
is it true?"	109.06261194798701
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming.	278.2029173632309
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	589.5988617645465
"my real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me.	433.05046996874216
the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth.	502.46284812611935
"my object then," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	628.1791189791247
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	455.6315432262049
but you do not know all.	79.23364361930668
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	748.5273994914081
it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	678.1353622509649
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	729.3587694739042
in talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	541.8603822517664
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	871.4947658114995
from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	804.1364517992309
"perhaps we might be deceived."	107.97247442574798
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	574.0682978928772
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	159.76671290769428
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	882.8014960402519
our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	430.3681138667945
catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	825.9245695766062
why is not every body as happy?"	235.9170180178406
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	713.4038277779827
but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	467.89437285472985
i told mrs collins so before you came.	247.38471364924538
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	583.2498463309445
he was exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	638.7586208322201
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.	598.6677653102653
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.	711.8745404423677
my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	599.1196942269535
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars.	496.4589363576595
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	353.0292269932306
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	382.4775128816138
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg: 1.e.1.	276.6796116330415
"implacable resentment is a shade in a character.	274.8598907847714
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	156.28965800851967
"as often as i can.	137.46564724888344
my youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	486.0930146121605
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself."	243.41936506762005
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."	449.0825213720552
1.b.	88.86496410271289

their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	477.53064837829476
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	228.42878930162672
"what do you mean, hill?	90.73853742701344
"it is not mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life."	174.26282659977082
they were to be off as soon as possible.	108.64872472044355

she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	319.5247254600949
three daughters married!	236.93562643653343
how unlucky!	92.43328989891329
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	331.87470711831963
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	380.5837837975652
there was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	411.0984889327861
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	565.0947472555804
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	508.2179796351697
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.	307.8466221357111
she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	365.1953052835301
however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	498.83093791541677
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	745.6039784210906
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.	579.8909512176352
"what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	222.8228970680735
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr darcy's steward.	629.9441605862538
mr bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house.	452.22274030368766
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!	601.8989690423975
she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.	298.2593195197053
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i was uncivil?	489.6464404614947
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	134.7115651842675
balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	482.7207306107031
and so, i suppose, they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	322.68692526204063
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	605.3439834781014
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"	559.4758862371393
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	287.9828288238319
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.	382.4962285473
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	254.18872137867973
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	139.76654318391275
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	727.1154882410043
bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	520.2578712302728
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am not one of them.	188.12384118949183
she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	626.8216294623724
in understanding darcy was the superior.	248.88339819722935
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful."	310.06350098192917
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	411.6617503555171
"yes; to the last.	77.70776652074166
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	100.44400992174013
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy.	592.268333688901
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."	327.00594283588714
"but i was embarrassed."	49.437108308895674
mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to-day?	622.6540885763077
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.	632.0751979800712
unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	447.80839108529324
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	560.9439123466648
charlotte the wife of mr collins, was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	674.8476400096928
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter.	442.72397104402756
"what do you think?	57.21793972478818
shall you like to have such a brother?"	316.5203668759743
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	521.2248639760207
she is almost three and twenty!	141.2090561271899
they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	297.28823520213984
"i cannot believe it.	37.88186659738045
it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has never seen the view."	212.982591460838
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	332.4836744883535
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	789.625511602679
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	389.48861569036114
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun."	208.9052624846492
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "are you pleased with kent?"	642.698769154743
a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	407.7082481152005
you alluded to something else.	160.35120199387353
chapter xxi.	87.2378589933409
but, lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."	208.89940258441993
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.	646.5869558656956
you must send john with the young ladies, mrs collins.	275.1431361671605
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."	302.7391113311713
put them next to your great uncle the judge.	528.2754987591838
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	286.0399145030506
his letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.	547.3529999605583
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	305.6698469333126
that he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	238.01060547522897
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received!	668.3380844421514
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	645.2401566479136
she received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.	619.151528779473
mr what's his name.	217.08020008494964
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr bingley, if she could.	177.130629193255
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--a short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again.	344.04525595326334
shocking!"	80.68653746086628
it was all conjecture."	50.257806078801195
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	187.68625616588682
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	682.7979405487578

for your sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss bennet?"	430.0408680350573
oh!	14.346523268075027
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	692.6418029788285
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	630.6789237603682
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	562.9647036879624
when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	739.6151722188584
cried elizabeth; "but how could that be?--how could his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	364.13154394931104
it is of all subjects my delight.	153.59261137188088
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	846.6586312702789
he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	459.0396146616559
my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!	393.7160106016505
it is of no consequence.	98.17908677150336
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day.	610.8546319865244
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."	541.317182688343
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	240.33182154883139
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not return it.	249.8407180399255
he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	297.33609432097086
chapter xvii.	61.44207151475285
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.	576.6378405405562
these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	562.4992948038935
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	447.1651367999467
she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	336.4414482573365
"can it be possible that he will marry her?"	179.24044066574
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	224.59250282844113
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	776.6992311158714
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it.	316.047980266812
"oh!"	13.041208659043962
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent.	594.1820557668408
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	733.284031005778
this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	499.6123123058098
his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	539.1472091927496
i will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	240.29976269434366
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	208.0789685451677
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.	235.68607186395303
any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it, if you had rather not.	508.04900142345707
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	144.75787165023883
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library."	450.33883869186025
chapter xix.	61.44207151475285
mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	623.0053101385346
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	526.7214070892484
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.	516.9385911274153
jane was by no means better.	102.26365493274875
not these two or three years perhaps."	188.59747966376352
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	474.9992624912688
she had ventured only one glance at darcy.	185.18731529170842
into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	617.9739671651962
"in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland."	238.09755342689692
let me never see either one or the other again!"	292.96009615109404
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."	197.28564295253912
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	152.90296572559097
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has too much truth.	300.50413083686357
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment.	155.19730568613366
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her.	340.0326525964865
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	569.8278515219952
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."	301.43213146456844
charles, when you build your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley."	469.4643010235369
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.	414.2722091256967
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	792.9588532770056
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	271.2766762966334
have a little compassion on my nerves.	316.03445472107865
they will take care not to outrun their income.	282.5381045945701
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	230.14595116849028
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	169.79119611659232
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	172.97526589201908
mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding.	115.72930454621235
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	344.6052383735578
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.	596.3297886951896
in his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.	722.7989067147084
mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone mr collins began.	220.0600726745493
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	245.22751641725648
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic works.	359.0684181028934
chapter viii.	49.077036267764335
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a kingdom!	215.31407448599379
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"	449.22583368807636
i shall like it of all things.	155.92817300408907
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	745.4698570634359
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i think it will be very tolerable.	519.9073068051504
good girl!	107.66150604262366
said he; "that is rather singular."	173.86646461726957
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	532.6958703707508
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	100.41649317168368
have all her friends left her?"	201.81893918508422
and that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	374.07584546306276
she was gone directly.	67.5101622874905
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	563.3185668504448
elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	306.67776048411747
i always had a value for him.	126.75105187222009
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	236.7912651331756
"exceedingly well.	59.649568008967236
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	434.3431209065605
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	261.9886696617245
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	606.680367167819
"oh, yes.	32.45584383019995
and gravely glancing at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i shall keep mine to swell my song."	626.0522792416048
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	264.4862228970109
do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	631.7662781145934
his doing so drew her notice.	211.56279233950647
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."	280.35912946121385
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	686.0623793997584
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	391.13816776926024
"yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	136.93592374373625
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly.	285.07721225508374
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.	316.32952706278394
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age."	211.559640192143
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	261.2894568768823
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	632.761182488967
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better.	466.13704693748593
but with me, it is not so.	91.7352494843644
pray read on."	78.46491378010292
a flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	954.5467661310059
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings.	561.3475173010037
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.	630.7413607738638
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	248.71352260898936
every body is disgusted with his pride.	284.4560658469817
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	493.9407067541271
chapter viii.	49.077036267764335
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	487.34873087877
he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	474.0133452519364
he has more to give.	112.19393431568774
they are gone down to newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not know how long.	471.09011789250275
her own thoughts were employing her.	167.51149236413778
"and quite alone?	77.04890179676913
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	581.6355489211356
when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.	390.40128426498393
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	702.3559175777866
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.	360.3862207051912
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton.	392.69890782563743
said she, as she looked in her face.	185.130436448471
he does not want abilities.	153.88996811102942
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.	590.7391447275884
he really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	597.6340683777912
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage every thing.	171.5243994271399
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at pemberley, mr darcy!"	290.1312268187203
only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	427.3698252195068
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	592.6589635776701
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions.	589.1665780572627
cried miss bingley.	54.450690483388925
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."	271.75237788491876
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is about."	264.2654892105813
they are all for what they can get.	255.72789896460742
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	266.67657860727337
heaven forbid!	173.8927810169038
said elizabeth.	27.947965846046525
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."	651.4447604322182
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	352.0773031620445
"oh!	7.596391247223825
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.	530.6676940762594
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	319.84535648525207
she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.	350.1782872234914
there was also a postscript to this effect.	219.43196253300445
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office."	499.62984944841344
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	857.6964040602853
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of you."	263.6678611435394
of course, we hope that you will support the project gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.	608.108056425348
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	448.3079662087597
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	550.8032499928452
thought she.	108.98236399170382
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.	358.5687135459031
his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	659.7428622270652
but i will not repine.	76.26851978411025
but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the room.	470.5376129969436
as a child i was taught what was right, but i was not taught to correct my temper.	433.70133119396655
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	588.419725899381
let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."	539.3641136541265
"he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."	568.7752831916571
their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	773.0851875775633
they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	752.0269690995301
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.	672.6369967670579
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah!	601.5345132260653
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.	778.7612600697545
"i am, dear sir, &c.	74.68566543503681
there is one point, on which i want your advice.	275.19464826374184
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.	451.65206072036284
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	208.08793616428508
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	480.0251402252465
mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	433.6707045308518
"books--oh!	74.09198782652837
cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley!	435.83600887393186
"miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	177.42819300548976
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	239.1490921107973
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	497.10593449959526
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	418.5668306167398
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	261.7062562451758
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	587.5980906679333
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.	511.7694909416651
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking openly.	619.2087570027162
there was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	420.71219213586755
it is unaccountable!	51.093676202414954
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i trust i am resigned.	593.655894747947
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	266.1933385944133
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was ill at netherfield?"	394.30405144065224
it convinced her, that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town.	300.4499564624553
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	453.9226702007342
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	415.52786797178555
"this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	771.2909968986293

you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	736.1589563184579
such a countenance, such manners!	276.7383836594823
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	143.14949925353932
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	226.6593547331369
he is perfectly amiable.	80.75342412477237
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your happiness.	493.596459474311
"lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	249.6080833476408
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	198.78602913197327
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	158.7787639233218
my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?	157.961589767127
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	669.2705527940152
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."	552.8944776352669
professor michael s.	155.8173182702994
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."	468.5912035180499
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least.	718.3947544144136
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	531.1637242092671
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	629.3757761629039
[illustration: a vicarage house.] pride and prejudice: a novel.	357.6935991784837
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	376.4366128542357
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective.	384.1834147378206
much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.	763.0041699485287
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.	459.4073341678383
"yes, very different.	57.048782892702114
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	155.49711648900845
having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy.	455.642745984302
when i went away, i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	312.0253467521468
as for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	757.2129629808439
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	507.37016649846004
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	624.3863097605738
but that is not the case here.	150.06234159939723
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	374.29937629809734
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr darcy!"	199.37079553594162
chapter ii.	87.2378589933409
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."	255.75907342038573
lydia declared herself satisfied.	173.6241713281778
there is a lady, it seems, a mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.	507.6476249642478
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	125.13323624438996
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	271.1851484575004
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	490.8544249510777
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	846.7502068050263
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."	363.673857831847
elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	588.9796271356741
she really looked almost wild."	113.8652699120718
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.	740.7089364125192
the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	392.8839130841946
console lady catherine as well as you can.	314.7617076208164
they then went away.	75.22393400297567
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady catherine.	221.32233617363121
that tall, proud man."	137.48263408195567
you see how continually we are engaged there.	263.88809095615204
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	653.1065933071939
vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	473.36355922555515
i am so grieved for him.	65.56369011967264
when is your turn to come?	231.39492192119508
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	184.79047376561664
1.e.5.	30.002190201055924
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	865.5011099408472
she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself.	458.9632948981833
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner:-- "you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	462.3306964413045
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	785.7141800936042
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"	616.4684200006009
wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	425.0134783752617
"i never saw any one so shocked.	106.15916091488059
said elizabeth.	27.947965846046525
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	714.9220166124843
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	534.8788038927448
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	173.58111236442798
i do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	297.07939899797213
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	204.40448640595505
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	580.5869186419129
my temper would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost for ever."	313.4576491225026
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered.	150.76812820190557
mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	307.7572912552114
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	381.7848949942427
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	667.4916443560184
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	556.7044500799236
she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza!	457.4587619813992
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	498.70963109572733
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	672.1608420766822
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well.	356.54459763838605
"your's sincerely, &c."	78.62846673605412
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	543.1311303196878
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	717.3073282965904
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	466.34422544627796
chapter iv.	61.44207151475285
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	131.57768330317563
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	676.6800946599191
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	352.0472804987864
"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	226.23332758462615
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.	390.8035887497517
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	376.81222492398314
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."	347.14539772932204
elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away.	438.4551966871554
in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	466.72324975263405
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home.	426.42896703250153
they may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	523.3507448722244
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	258.0498036583057
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	378.9832839958602
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	301.3621426810573
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself.	615.0512797996893
"she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away!	230.12563534547147
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	354.8305662202396
mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	582.6123413444321
"i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter!"	416.5813001403353
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	779.2923498939357
1.e.7.	30.002190201055924
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him."	163.33198567718273
mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.	557.5030693467542
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"	618.5447036495052
he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months.	559.9932490779981
yet he is such a man!"	148.19920973361826
he seldom appeared really animated.	197.1231627209201
i am perfectly satisfied.	53.43881880800413
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."	353.6474266007626
as they drove to mr gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	668.0864935200939
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	359.16850793222386
i was uncomfortable enough.	65.55877655265031
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	430.71017114994333
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	724.2668108609822
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.	268.1305652201016
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	427.94915705437757
never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated to colonel f.	497.2354269726542
very well.	55.7602864002392
yes, i call it a very easy distance."	230.01477325539284
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	409.59277575113805
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	348.94793774303787
there was no want of discourse.	157.8086169615623
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield.	559.0061127244056
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	514.0315754983586
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	561.5047173487122
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	203.05510355905247
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	198.662182665075
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	980.5003124060834
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	841.6448379815678
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	500.2419370831078
in this danger kitty is also comprehended.	272.9297918582559
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	212.86441705335503
it only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	418.60812973002595
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.	649.8075485263546
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.	232.6968414285618
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	134.9348641266656
"it is no such thing.	63.4218828581604
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	704.8046172238234
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."	297.344502122452
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	469.35397272923285
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	153.28071074084787
chapter i.	49.08112948229592
"that you certainly shall."	65.9858222139312
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health.	370.70063504172134
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	826.19729448738
he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "just as you please."	333.98706630636565
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	250.62047065994742
"but why all this secrecy?	118.89939764965939
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	789.0928914400218
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	189.29680526817063
"not one."	38.85044848770033
"my dear friend, "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	632.9558887388921
is she handsome?"	109.01723034107144
it was then disclosed in the following manner.	168.59188108563714
"indeed i am.	56.164999112639904
it was first broken by mrs annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	790.9972295458388
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	322.70525722610273
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	395.24503683840544
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	317.3984419177909
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."	623.6523007920426
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	534.8395549221582
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	354.3748653643519
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.	348.4014115094522
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	80.52393679222462
i did for you.	61.83575159403968
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.	826.899370395728
"i think she will.	64.04087691719774
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	134.85549302572434
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!	432.3320443837471
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire.	382.56785756406225
about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	424.64918318049996
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes.	566.0997804191024
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.	688.9257015517815
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	548.1860611528544
it was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."	264.844575426208
she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	620.3315801211526
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	583.2953511613119
bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	436.5871591126124
your reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' those were your words.	607.3953204840593
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	884.7745126705702
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	715.9604108584282
i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	366.0039782956071
he studies too much for words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	291.48340211487977
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	699.8016928685915
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt.	581.4857687117204
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	611.0539695555436
this son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	564.2269330677603
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	427.4677409722994
i will think no more about him."	91.15728058872688
but it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."	280.2728362025843
the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?"	274.286644546932
what do you keep winking at me for?	264.1961536731095
repeated mr bennet.	122.32713662051293
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	818.7932148110489
had i known what i ought, what i dared, to do!	453.23486482985044
it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	300.68114157775466
it was all pride and insolence.	134.9025765560431
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	295.8764368529974
where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	479.96706469501936
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	625.5232956177773
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.	821.112043780024
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth: "my dearest lizzy, "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	699.1961544955443
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	382.0486771558042
it was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	263.0782907635365
she related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	508.5628942605677
oh!	14.346523268075027
"one of them does."	87.81748299222566
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	347.61059071130563
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane.	542.7281387795119
the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	674.2016447611406
these recollections will not do at all.	196.82976366913437
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	644.4139713019615
brother-in-law of wickham!	214.55890250508986
as the day of his arrival drew near, "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	343.1867851702121
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	692.5398030802774
lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	998.0643190968538
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	743.2279030407959
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	181.48237006912802
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing to him.	310.4247658218389
from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	490.6632615501818
on finding mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"	573.627412017489
there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	409.93519344023264
"removed!"	47.38600550038393
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.	527.8875823294045
after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	803.1424676633377
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	441.06316434720145
it was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of her's.	206.99743635270823
chapter iii.	46.489774947193354
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	452.2538000339447
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."	227.87998130124214
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	275.4190573054541
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	482.72961426806154
well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	476.9864357031297
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	485.36714840820974
widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	551.110239671639
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.	167.94697555871167
cried elizabeth when she had finished it.	124.96776324226298
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	699.5077862307535
it is admirable!"	52.263308907982726
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."	224.03438418643023
but lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	250.56972920586597
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	148.61501000983222
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	289.5758108124135
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	653.3045395404024
how can they suit each other?--do you know mr bingley?"	273.0249377500823
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	259.26345896656096
mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	633.3636708503893
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	477.8091987634916
i know it to be impossible."	75.26580082160359
on opening the door, she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	804.9158983530289
he shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."	210.99834008402493
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	619.7739556945817
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	80.05566180188318
at length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends."	480.08794929256624
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	157.86124817082646
mrs bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.	735.6863480094712
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	327.77444302858623
i came to you without a doubt of my reception.	263.3067240698161
i now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him.	253.44854024137362
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often do."	316.3580066129344
do not repeat what i then said.	234.89344712847094
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	242.8165033591403
family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.	682.5954223795211
for forty years, he produced and distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	715.8821917857433
the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	878.7630712850324
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by them."	732.915394241955
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	290.44623434464336
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	656.556585959903
you supposed more than really existed.	256.38890012741564
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	235.86386687712636
your tempers are by no means unlike.	255.67484298153155
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	374.73512530126914
their fortune on both sides is splendid.	298.60026802948636
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	572.3158666236892
so much the better.	75.86864022740865
"mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	136.24528885889714
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	179.30048700740758
mr and mrs gardiner smiled.	88.28547651142154
i enquired after their brother, of course.	197.5617300580337
he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	449.67477227273577
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	578.1688067417057
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	271.1117255177197
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	174.59766231331835
i hope she will turn out well."	123.97835214086051
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	511.4801513557117
calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	832.4849233247174
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	568.2325891506528
ring the bell, kitty, for hill.	335.3884667238526
"your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	251.4612697061215
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over.	645.7653373653623
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	412.98388933691564
the path just admitted three.	192.88307015351967
"are they indeed?"	79.84484049583575
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all."	213.27972355780415
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.	617.4669991198867
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	215.09463978236033
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."	389.296391013217
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	315.0844024399206
"indeed i had.	63.13034296352336
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!	315.6718933504179
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	174.43543002501468
the period of expectation was now doubled.	252.98428344441578
good bye.	103.20958366796829
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	376.1802638417991
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	532.6018397471265
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	404.91307574041673
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.	324.81031527582513
i defy even sir william lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	317.1495438271253
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	786.5024558547328
they must be a great loss to your family."	165.00969435859028
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."	412.88535828990894
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	223.80815991616367
"your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy."	442.2599312572928
he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	512.9975398426689
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	690.086924818953
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	479.8321197943418
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr bingley to her."	222.42604039727726
his sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	794.8994750347997
"did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me?	173.45287216867345
my sole dependence was on you; and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	239.68588107488782
will you come and see me?"	204.961426097115
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	406.36063063110464
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	353.43305422674496
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	499.65870055602034
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."	446.6581753648553
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	120.31282703411283
"indeed!"	23.95268227215021
he cannot afford it.	78.43253448872849
i grieve to find, however, that colonel f.	181.87031680190503
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	434.42301717714304
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."	379.1859251293123
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	583.6442881272799
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	609.0634363913231
and is it really true?	213.88274732820324
your's, very sincerely, "m.	281.6144932518197
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	233.9272100701019
nothing could console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her resentment.	513.5512823641751
perhaps she is full young to be much in company.	443.5009468534315
now is your time.	155.34634041491415
"did charlotte dine with you?"	119.36729753016608
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	285.41020635266386
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall i call it?	433.48897708657057
as long as she stays there, it is all very well.	243.4327370864971
his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	434.92221978970605
"with the officers!"	78.6972173745149
our poor mother is sadly grieved.	332.2282994206129
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.	236.7802874356851
"i certainly shall not.	61.49499014647235
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	563.7892338742705
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	285.28502187441774
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	243.23514997714227
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	681.3313920141092
1.f.2.	44.15539294892887
i hope they will not meet at all.	134.49153358060337
the other is miss de bourgh.	117.91483408949401
there was another reason too for her opposition.	288.6883920433518
he knows of my being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	517.1289803909593
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.	478.9072678525393
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	149.27021673368975
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem.	470.69905874918027
whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.	551.9905373015166
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	147.41663302945
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	321.6560238730374
yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again.	534.0727232015217
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	552.1127942208943
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	551.4026537707251
elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	705.5318070551047
his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	343.31360759098254
i can recal nothing worse.	135.38397914650918
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	316.95572063296345
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	283.9690097818781
presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	750.4676658568859
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	113.06591318335735
it was agreed to.	58.400404476848536
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."	501.9346116176715
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	154.76379873403997
every thing that is charming!	177.84557596203044
what are men to rocks and mountains?	291.47636649847897
are you going much farther?"	171.88602263904505
mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in reply to his last.	397.66435655262734
at present i am not in love with mr wickham; no, i certainly am not.	298.90360527254353
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	139.32581086600243
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	746.6518821000235
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	198.5896362465638
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	746.4173765975896
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	584.7477072756218
repeated miss bingley.	95.43719572860492
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."	331.24339969643444
she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	214.31082318175015
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.	719.5200425053074
"nearly three weeks."	67.75789216850002
"perhaps i do.	59.86067427119869
"insolent girl!"	73.06465048261708
"i hope not."	26.061579322927244
every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	413.2268620349541
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give into it.	529.9813287691488
this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	514.0052870837461
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte, detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	787.2684259306297
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton.	667.6169556271662
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	541.3792311303785
why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"	474.2684433617394
you deserve no such attention.	145.54071251431148
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	120.35702290595377
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	506.78583824241053
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	668.9714373111483
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!	311.32886075283886
it is impossible that he should still love me."	104.36894261636722

when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing farther to wish.	406.8000713050734
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton.	480.0093534598123
how is such a man to be worked on?	265.0865708501312
the happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	662.5039071158051
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	468.77982346328736
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	304.041942309735
what is it about?	144.36770852686826
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	151.07438065092018
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."	670.6706482349078
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	797.4451547985532
as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	683.4106018122538
but that gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."	305.4388721988585
if i had ever learnt, i should have been a great proficient.	233.32059518041007
the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	472.37426734105935
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	419.63998563702694
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	657.1279711290232
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	593.1449247905488
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	717.1505250341032
however, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg-tm work in a format other than "plain vanilla ascii" or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "plain vanilla ascii" or other form.	611.8631348661145
lord!	47.92677388112846
for such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	763.5870341508927
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	115.21005342049283
on this subject, what can you have to say?	251.38683356713534
mr collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons.	810.2911393864107
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	195.2408736878478
my sweetest lizzy!	96.64329210627989
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	183.44848556939286
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention; the other is charlotte's marriage.	406.6662883876354
is not he a charming man?	197.25365011951587
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."	341.06100198472575
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	724.1554987303427
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	470.73350035516387
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	156.27441147208728
"no, i believe not."	45.296510084879664
he has not an ill-natured look.	164.0270965999249
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"she did indeed, louisa.	137.58500465229477
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing.	143.92512387832414
he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	804.8716804792747
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's way."	258.89747569170487
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	344.66440028640744
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	310.756018791945
"what, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	301.9125557444028
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	345.77627002418234
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	265.3065523575309
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	375.8060054113924
his understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	430.4554928389716
mrs wickham!	73.12397912786716
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	658.0268950022996
you are lucky in having such a master."	188.3398961213671
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."	565.1970643676025
my poor father!	115.25829259872114
i will read it to you-- "when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	752.7300680146882
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.	432.45678468827685
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	658.4968668444907
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	232.4607823322261
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	350.67461681544637
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	412.58151064195994
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr bingley," said her mother, "i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr bennet's manor.	356.59887718719295
"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	443.82243690488093
what could be more natural than his asking you again?	327.814588349163
at present we have nothing to guide us.	234.3775341528695
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	241.24136873929365
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	397.227397521728
but vanity, not love, has been my folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	738.8337078379559
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	357.3343115848351
anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	920.5736822558124
what a contrast between him and his friend!	240.9784225271848
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."	252.5832085723665
nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	655.2707423669183
wont it, kitty?"	198.65883670319104
the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	542.1297871383724
jane was distressed.	88.03955719170708
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."	650.4546677555038
he did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	691.644341720421
change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."	545.2283501511782
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	659.5325977267054
she saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	482.80182075273325
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	652.6292305663061
he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	596.3266608864704
how well it sounds.	185.87279111850796
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town next saturday."	241.23469705805374
but there are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever to pay him."	607.3601865664109
the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	539.3859962125586
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	314.1666332594826
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	228.48836813383835
why must their marriage be private?	296.78247518208303
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."	255.3823565258779
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."	193.36577006162963
but i confess they would have no charms for me.	208.16371315663872
i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	205.92753109281352
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	461.437525168203
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	548.141299740309
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	791.8135915078287
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as you.	325.13309223193943
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	471.847802142401
"i told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	473.7387638244399
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	684.2307524946733
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	380.4754447021145
i thank you for explaining it so fully.	242.12521042352503
"how so?	53.907667372769275
but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it."	247.453201273328
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	177.6197179180788
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	472.6471954962783
they insist also on my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.	697.7432248532913
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's?	245.32188824529544
he replied, and was again silent.	139.88548457782113
"ten thousand pounds!	96.05978803728382
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	643.6406398523218
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	545.8586806323513
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.	121.92669816948957
they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	705.7038312989645
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.	457.01641210241013
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	337.79153521464366
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	115.66829779539387
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.	690.3561376877509
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it.	197.9623752597181
chapter xxii.	87.2378589933409
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	797.158438513215
"oh!"	13.041208659043962
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	389.579338122476
it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy!	542.7659348796307
lydia laughed, and said, "aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	421.2572745124584
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth.	791.9049728170903
but does not jane correspond with the sister?	325.2822066076371
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states.	468.04990049491704
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	313.6092652897023
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	467.3737189776291
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage.	283.3745249968439
the business was therefore soon settled.	182.30471027177666
both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	231.89393775072674
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	518.5361654753306
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	488.11520122054736
she is grown so brown and coarse!	211.9984352950866
"a gamester!"	54.22596839456319
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner.	422.7681255867661
the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	812.9407574284897
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	607.5686822319789
but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	598.5414292776273
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	349.1775556629548
he has heartily forgiven me now."	98.11365892657226
we will go round the park every day.	212.9673949101489
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	380.80657335327817
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	371.8746939809851
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	376.71635153164794
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	343.39794639357837
indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	644.0543170821278
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	815.8466519079525
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	361.1668777733506
but she would not be secure.	109.543553144702
there was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	712.2666296167401
do any thing rather than marry without affection.	291.6454236732052
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	439.4949058517804
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham's attentions.	507.3210940341366
"i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	249.80362426376652
now, lizzy, i think i have surprised you.	190.30897882456063
but, however, he is very welcome to come to netherfield, if he likes it.	201.7227537264901
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley."	301.2780073105012
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now.	339.42306877692084
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses."	324.3869453002124
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	545.7025525763969
did you see it?"	100.83411108661973
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	618.6460522311776
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	195.1129078917171
it distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage.	433.6720605622814
"and mary king is safe!"	114.14262744828757
"this is wholly unexpected.	78.80734897024823
you must learn some of my philosophy.	220.40981613798297
on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	834.405931142534
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	163.38912516722962
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	420.52618544688477
you blamed me for coming?"	139.5413035341602
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	415.4008830181709
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	322.75979975318677
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	260.1020350827632
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr darcy only, entered the room.	553.4567608753641
it will not do.	56.99158909735644
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	537.9164312733924
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	549.2119544002077
miss lucas is married and settled.	205.70756645298994
his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time.	501.93619082040397
five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	345.34851134104196
her colour changed, and she said no more.	174.01377043342825
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side.	503.10312794208033
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?"	373.62217917100764
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	717.65596853447
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	676.1474686713317
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	580.7796469172763
well, any friend of mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him."	424.48886843273834
i cannot quite agree with you there.	171.6825776447259
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	231.99212967830434
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	678.3514916575766
colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	651.439326471793
how acutely did she now feel it.	194.66870634778113
"yes.	23.148995539536628
she answered him with cold civility.	161.95009826775384
mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	493.36517272492495
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	774.6773623761369
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, i am sure you did.	304.80159569472926
she dared not even mention that gentleman.	208.02777513905224
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to befall her?"	293.1563563301524
and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."	573.8502562743166
"but consider your daughters.	87.00302511187745
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north.	479.53275872931226
that is all settled."	80.67338109775106
i thought i should have died.	114.77523488101683
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	751.4424138634154
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns.	907.7962772561508
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	588.5753626889472
"oh!	7.596391247223825
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	369.62941637583253
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	269.26367132137756
his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	805.2464767056332
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife?"	257.0624771476753
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	386.1873473579821
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	362.124257718348
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am gone."	637.7822637964068
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.	535.5411829380258
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	553.551694962535
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	250.43143821580824
but it must not, shall not be.	138.4570733893886
it is a pity they are not handsome!	132.38225066747572
lord, how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty!	503.8383125529682
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together.	484.5110398205916
chapter xv.	49.077036267764335
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "project gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1 through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or 1.e.9.	225.81777685489266
"the present always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	282.5733024034618
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	432.3149390132313
they are my old friends.	132.40982272695632
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	323.5772541807779
"we have heard only once.	104.26347713108932
but make a virtue of it by all means.	282.8259045524552
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	678.3129654345289
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	222.79150987698833
their situation was awkward enough; but her's she thought was still worse.	469.9339779744633
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter.	608.2604284769318
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	102.48668408190292
society, i own, is necessary to me.	315.2854034303486
he has children of his own, and may have more.	200.96936307115308
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."	605.6693175120417
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	634.8865620039262
but she is nothing to me now.	149.13092677624684
and now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.	562.2864282001328
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	408.05765358057806
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.	486.9955330199417
but i hope you will not mind it: it is all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.	336.7290628418701
but it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	408.8895042114712
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	255.36353609299033
but mrs bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	155.0619737757055
she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."	344.8458763318048
his surprise was great.	122.36382909504476
mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	474.2540771859703
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	114.05012946760583
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	231.50270581897442
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the case?"	380.5922664951969
her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	561.3980430387495
there was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.	657.4019559117822
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	152.78994529032414
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	406.0691884073684
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	262.1285014185711
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.	968.0697890969984
i shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance i require."	269.81709930711025
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	473.6730062853331
mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	507.8925146383058
1.e.9.	30.002190201055924
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not know of any prepossession;--her eldest daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	681.7171911111503
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	358.22916973190956
"you go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds!	335.5933203290468
mr jones says we must not think of moving her.	252.47133139181372
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	525.3610362376899
this invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.	350.72527729733156
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	811.9079465676015
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	354.4179135449006
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."	304.0103181957435
but mr gardiner could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.	440.1262663560814
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	650.8046310252682
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	828.5038177106707
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.	473.9954060800929
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	239.08045170013503
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	551.767599844489
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	341.028677811858
he cannot know what mr darcy is."	105.37750626000569
did he know of their intending to go off?	457.23614565592936
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	316.9326683020865
i will go directly to mr bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	193.53613153675286
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	768.6036233391408
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	376.8361557116459
human nature is so prone to fall into it!	528.2015552110191
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	293.9140229061076
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.	315.84112908457644
elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.	491.94498882702646
they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.	278.75924693318194
this mrs younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	458.63819097963466
the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.	332.4961198756229
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	601.3807252817271
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.	756.7695305022521
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."	236.59174834005418
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	363.55673183841884
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	498.5700229880172
i am very glad you liked her.	82.38212610656944
"i see no occasion for that.	81.02755806671897
in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	473.188556260541
"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if i should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	347.6159376662343
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	516.7335692030132
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	157.10446374706862
"has she been presented?	157.97995893658907
however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	283.11513303178674
what felicity!	89.56923068865065
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	479.93403593052693
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	512.0699293587328
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	678.973352496216
he was always to have gone on saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	380.9125251728693
then pray speak aloud.	198.73872227730135
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	424.5902919455999
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	352.5765898402995
section 2.	57.391444475601546
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	227.8175313404757
"blame you!	74.15594424751708
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	192.14191783740898
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	402.7209859793447
darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	547.5312989658217
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	625.8906735500532
if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	368.32304610868914
cried elizabeth.	24.868521698769708
when she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	734.4851099586033
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	500.8992628466317
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	777.3191348901299
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	160.82176815569346
"merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.	347.9542019166112
"that is his notion of christian forgiveness!	171.41146123256746
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	589.3519210496426
"indeed!"	23.95268227215021
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham.	234.90140032340435
chapter i.	49.08112948229592
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	834.8001649973334
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	456.1121966289883
you have delighted us long enough.	146.91986908511154
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	264.76378446634453
"bingley."	30.898583867873565
it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.	228.99954250963006
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way.	275.6550771646329
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london.	474.29472854691403
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	155.3628579149251
his fear of her, has always operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he has very much at heart."	521.4329741369942
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	364.5152398559131
it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	244.44847080877344
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	694.9324727462439
we will know where we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen.	482.5099032006579
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor i, nor any body, can ever forget.	436.561267549803
but when they see, as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."	577.0888597101058
miss darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	492.3852114847698
"oh, well!	49.69632296224928
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	427.8662978111945
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	462.1950175319419
but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.	844.7241152049069
but these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	368.86680908940434
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	678.6355827337187
my watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	615.9683317425305
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	716.966977799421
there, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.	340.6625278121327
oh, brother, how kind you are!	316.30049465893086
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	185.45834400745946
"why will you think so?	155.44355457390176
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	574.8399566839109
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	164.0026666980715
girls, can i do any thing for you in meryton?	541.5721116940911
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	535.8590554573034
i depend on you for that."	133.31859885636533
who attended to you?	173.9396100748193
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	231.2573262933082
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	370.21514628517264
"is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	699.4174731053342
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.	519.0741747281894
one seems so forlorn without them."	163.26357821950018
they had long wished to see him.	116.15424950179391
"what does mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?"	303.2711363901882
not a soul knew of it, but col.	323.1668600295079
his character was to speak for itself.	241.27623296879852
why should they try to influence him?	276.1193698441044
"he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."	397.3179036622119
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor."	260.7913831397214
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of humility.	265.74104708715856
said jane.	47.123044703500916
they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas.	740.837910764523
"and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"	324.60531968224865
"if i were as rich as mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	342.4081634447826
that is all to be forgot.	225.7861685783395
you and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the party."	616.2318731668715
it is what every body says.	122.90079910196788
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping lucases.	666.5852505999085
she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	454.1125532622035
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	558.6669088709601
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.	663.6715759839803
charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say.	237.83805754215632
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	579.1585808462322
i have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	342.61289180995556
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.	663.8143268042884
my feelings will not be repressed.	187.2831723304658
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."	448.4077609372725
engraved for no.	214.3411849428382
as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	848.7440172243504
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	862.8712215361325
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.	233.7917160390611
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings.	474.9660101947534
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	475.8283266574805
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!	391.57745425307144
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure," said he.	164.9848303746877
this however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	717.5915208986057
"if he wants our society, let him seek it.	230.4376722585489
how can it affect them?"	137.5130588987305
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	544.0962522943511
wickham passed all his youth there, you know."	213.54186030981157
well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	562.774139544568
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	823.0913075836177
in three volumes.	126.44913412108318
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."	245.14267017977355
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family.	485.18033940895936
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	364.91313958376514
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.	637.5831430823148
no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	398.21171317871455
he was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	299.25658083658715
her power was sinking; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	721.8850868327088
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals.	356.96881838355256
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	899.377466075851
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	703.1228647492779
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	362.79290426729915
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	655.5976534630312
she added, "by far too much.	110.22567250255072
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	432.99530269683385
mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	426.7234511345782
that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as mr bingley, was incomprehensible.	735.1037258607805
mary and kitty, thank heaven!	173.55590487119673
mr darcy may hug himself."	69.62231580359943
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!	570.1587623560004
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done!	416.1441087818993
i guessed as much."	80.09090403780203
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.	275.39306291663354
your sister i also watched.--her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--if you have not been mistaken here, i must have been in an error.	696.6403589050376
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	643.0783982296666
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	465.75313437646196
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	386.13687810877275
recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	453.86563700361586
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	745.087122679139
but now it comes out."	82.0296739151627
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."	440.53095575871714
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"	414.00174352266464
gardiner."	33.31299353634879
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	629.7291871024931
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together."	640.5528348499017
you shall hear what she says."	129.73549967628352
for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	373.71444738005584
however, i recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well."	455.75665927904254
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	473.40052427752045
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	269.4939887991417
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	572.4197609174771
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	163.66723562331774
i am ashamed of you!	100.3155088476248
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.	623.1968656157875
it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	561.5928546150927
"no, she would go home.	84.48474620158622
if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	211.5789278319396
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you say that he was at rosings?"	355.3436716727654
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	698.0755261346427
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	493.6210646530016
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	705.4833149152106
"oh, lizzy!	33.872866597468075

"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge?"	291.972128945406
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	459.22485727584046
were it known to the rest of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	328.7981382050664
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	509.4276545412122
we want none of them; do we?"	237.21181391543684
"but not before they went to brighton?"	154.71860947645655
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at pemberley.	731.288149422103
i cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as i often see done."	407.07228951014827
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	292.37053247404157
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	144.79517273214563
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	435.3436701570134
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	535.9564916789145
"i cannot make him out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	422.5022234190258
well, how pleased i am!	219.97200914996714
what congratulations will then flow in!	277.4152656846931
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	363.74859372285226
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	534.9937952304768
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	570.804843790176
where is your sash my dear?"	221.19565088237252
how rich and how great you will be!	255.67915235586727
cried jane.	48.61155963121143
"indeed you are mistaken.	78.08137583529923
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	206.515647690938
but now it was all too natural.	199.27267702639824
i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.	415.4516348121649
"but how did he account for it?"	122.08713440066639
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy.	264.51783201474404
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	432.2684306244602
i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	549.4194775134048
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	714.210509950732
not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things i know are all chance in this world.	572.8671979900151
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	367.2692526812984
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter.	306.1978047871231
had his character been known, this could not have happened.	298.6652388712757
elizabeth looked surprised.	84.1176012156433
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	265.07308787285837
come be quick, be quick!	368.18462675167495
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	753.6508482870212
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	608.1457637674041
mr collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	371.75732466345477
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.	809.3151281463921
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	853.8622537501114
not that i care about it, though.	229.2349652634279
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane.	261.2304859896267
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again."	361.72335605900525
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	215.7779536800648
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."	863.2151319215867
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.	359.45399746319475
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	314.4377971929449
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	264.94645427255944
he readily agreed to it.	95.96762765984614
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	655.5396130990482
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	408.66246208902743
mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	250.48077796087267
"all!--what, all five out at once?	287.2748405013691
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	333.3363141258756
1.f.6.	44.15539294892887
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	158.58963812956353
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	140.70625828944537
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	507.7736393657468
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	296.6208004485786
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	638.9089169297573
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.	310.2277987004681
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	368.50945402500764
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!	337.7258850110957
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	600.6408785495921
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	373.3550292223571
bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever.	325.6275042996958
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	246.4093742497253
to mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	663.0619374461645
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	437.77515673363996
but i have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world."	387.96613160738036
from their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	353.9911114050819
as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	707.8644967870839
i see the imprudence of it.--oh!	96.22581318951102
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	162.01195671453786
i cannot understand it.	58.01906219993613
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs long has just been here, and she told me all about it."	256.977102037295
he shall not be in love with me, if i can prevent it."	151.18079861181104
but, really, i know not what to say.	149.22515385021393
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	835.1771607281579
"how can you be smiling so, lizzy?"	117.83697282643118
i am quite well.	42.42144680358902
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."	311.06495509715495
and i think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	578.9290056090305

"oh!	7.596391247223825
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you must marry.	707.6180285274565
their table was superlatively stupid.	245.305939028065
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	387.39200423375127
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	517.3000304265357
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.	632.5354676472704
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about.	423.2560754753066
an airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	260.7703890571895
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton.	494.33901995503345
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	318.9839415205004
"wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's."	292.2707018674388
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	412.9496897864222
"there is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	342.2538608424508
"you must not blame my aunt.	101.09413106982863
"nothing child, nothing.	118.95414577531945
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	604.4543945934703
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	554.9390370454062
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	863.7483222151765
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	452.0093062014863
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	720.0181719477156
"oh!	7.596391247223825
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	646.1132008169157
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."	399.45644324481646
mr collins then returned to elizabeth.	107.67590918580868
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	544.4815968187494
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	701.6194502997442
is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very ill."	445.25068375437843
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	535.5287905898873
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	238.81677275802667
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	754.6223828305211
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	752.5596119308477
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	505.19771107168384
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	453.6013366016104
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	547.5354070819212
promise me, therefore, to come to hunsford."	194.68554444942674
every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.	603.2181329479911
however, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."	484.4721139178537
his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	329.1988568333436
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	822.1381170691204
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire."	648.9910168069973
she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	584.6858572022853
but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person."	473.49014156210046
he made no answer.	45.771526390461645
we seem to have been designed for each other."	150.1456112510927

it is highly improper.	92.96820852000965
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i wish he had danced with eliza."	233.04402084407226
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope, though you have but a short lease."	328.5896483909686
pray, how violent was mr bingley's love?"	227.32173023586114
they saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	386.0378906933832
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	260.34188548181976
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."	288.93828043905256
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	579.7478121050108
she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	260.70947089687684
"good god!	61.301181596779706
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	389.92316750120824
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	292.84337004650297
mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.	415.20828792543864
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	659.0509920115472
and she was only sixteen last june.	188.58777092051668
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley.	291.828242230242
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	423.9972549551044
to all the objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	427.86113982531674
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	191.3750120094117
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards miss king.	519.7897944950502
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	442.55145174422864
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	742.8423829194647
it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it.	399.8879951681323
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	170.5321983557434
i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."	270.36070279233587

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	140.65154086222418
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	626.291900160721
well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	281.6582234522638
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.	319.16815267269203
and so would anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.	430.21652797885963
with your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!	479.37408398877375
jane was beyond competition her favourite child.	247.64218037658475
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.	581.5399877625086
he looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley.	386.92271943194504
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"	468.8409847434306
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	161.11621529902837
i do not trust my own partiality.	143.56870010601668
"certainly not."	30.818642385142645
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	486.45660891336854
"she looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	279.79975694421705
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	522.5692804868936
i shall go distracted."	59.84038461832825
by supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.	714.5550320246888
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	799.4536068197904

caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."	502.015633868959
"we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	287.3487231374169
i should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	238.39596283190482
i told my sister philips so the other day.	215.49031262982587
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away; it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.	582.8598563371387
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	596.1091539770266
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	334.9804014321189
she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	641.2794360698388

"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	192.75693819867425
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever heard you utter.	187.56663692845092
you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	646.5673439363189

in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	531.0544357088501
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	429.9988973668749
"but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be brought to reason.	156.79429805843358
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	494.700070026766
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	96.09356239262652
"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her brother--"because he does not write with ease.	375.6428730938606

his character was decided.	110.46560254223768
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	705.9449397721818
6.	16.117565948606046
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	541.4734397240446
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.	390.2985297656887
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	863.7709524270172

in the hall they parted.	167.39092093899004
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	715.7070242869138
elizabeth silently attended her.	87.65437361104301
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	505.3820633693043
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."	429.9438309673498
* * * * * it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.	654.5627050346429
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	517.1054919161959
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	744.178180744015
but papa is so disagreeable."	124.2973901473277
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present.	597.8558676488288
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	720.6186667149459
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.	397.3946841916958
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."	535.7031461072908
indeed he has no improper pride.	318.5074571321499
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	565.8220846383047
mr collins was eloquent in her praise.	158.21969508610866
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire."	195.03275315242718
she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	553.5599229992042
it would be dreadful!	75.26304173355344
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.	948.7826555030767
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	107.46791521204158
we now come to the point.	160.72371270633082
in confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	646.1704827809949
ten thousand a year!	153.001895528674
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	688.6766775355559
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	905.245358834136
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	341.56883482131326
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	440.865785216514
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.	807.8584764761813
"it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	150.0602033332875
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster, the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described.	516.0168024424119
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.	380.97553182795446
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect.	181.56713766508864
when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	446.12489758052357
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	639.5090666341192
it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it."	158.83969664453753
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	394.50007769101524
their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	804.8072489847399
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	633.4120543724233
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.	452.469765525651
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	195.70994646493747
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	697.6686079531398
came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	847.4821770022228
"oh!	7.596391247223825
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	572.2544880035658
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	544.1099067927723
it would have been strange if they had.	132.1053250092687
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not know."	144.38732364421656
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	804.0121979268646
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	597.2173910210473
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	531.662135780313
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards."	473.045789054782
1.e.3.	30.002190201055924
but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.	489.0079057487599
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	279.328749503734
darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.	420.07389980564284
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	617.5255908206465
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	605.074688799245
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	688.0196874875454
elizabeth made no answer.	35.76564092498741
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice?	807.4825542268117
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	458.86046328851086
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to say.	101.1597516148949
"i never heard any thing so abominable.	126.78065772327736
mr bennet made no answer.	53.50501265448613
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	398.3335796430904
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	536.6594997392175
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	159.99327677479693
what i have to say relates to poor lydia.	241.09054603125884
for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	525.0956717511388
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	196.27873063185527
very odd!--and you only the second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your younger sisters must be very young?"	405.1456199049779
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before they did.	675.5386832748901

she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."	798.0276611462971
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	107.39936482569513
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration.	183.52060371608763
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	397.09974710046583
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.	267.9544958038491
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	473.8486477011626
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from caroline.	460.4187847916328
how can mr bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	565.1357293923156
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	784.3008506429508
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	133.1005602071477
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty.	719.647556499202
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	239.54089060109533
"not at all."	22.07051995696359
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	841.4212467593123
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	266.89583182848577
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, william collins."	497.08589473046817
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i come."	456.5142734650459
thursday was to be the wedding day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	615.0991772836854
it would have suited me in every respect."	134.5053628895046
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"	766.5995280186156
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence.	297.9047004921418
we do not suffer by accident.	215.69525028153754
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson; did not i mention it to you?	492.76863399135146
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make me happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."	469.3673277670636
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	134.19360214308435
"i wish it may."	43.13122831175126
she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	841.6544677093136
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	187.37427915578863
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	410.0910209090072
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	510.56395395340815
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."	473.0123308874206
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	851.8250188547152
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	806.4345947974695
you have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	297.4822095344839
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	224.84670921935
it was unpardonable.	53.427733655219555
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said bingley.	211.22669727740188
said elizabeth, still addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	158.80610412023793
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	564.7943921599034
cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	92.30145138246944
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	627.4856066656105
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion."	258.84762055599685
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	212.62150235686144
when they repaired to the dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	517.4027112406023
but the case is this.	109.81929406531067
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do.	373.6714037067164
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	656.1893437859436
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	449.3456098065434
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	353.0341181938922
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is impossible.	483.33955902598944
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in me."	355.42610418507394
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	742.8337040674159
but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	719.9656132029344

the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	482.9927566056768
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects.	366.7049558408114
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."	159.10315334682636
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	291.96645880450467

his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	336.4344768108599
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	291.3720487691619

elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	651.1100221000164
it was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	384.08636379503923

bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	307.5319809094074
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."	446.1381574826452
my situation in life, my connections with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	702.7172106057462
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	481.40721837944136
"yes, yes, they must marry.	104.08531058524221
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.	514.8924692925315
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia.	485.1653052787386
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	490.68667568616127
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration.	295.8475061767695
mr collins!"-- "my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	249.22950951194386
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it be not so, let mr darcy contradict it.	595.6519081501879
she respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	741.846546256403
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	84.99971826312303
mr bennet treated the matter differently.	187.6405677898738
in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	218.136190422078

do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	666.5796540508502
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."	541.0752920920299

as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	467.314300766628

"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	186.44157466123707
so, do not put yourself to inconvenience."	226.22855131291456
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	506.32080655665743
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	440.31410341195703
when a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."	497.25626786662616
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	737.3087071037701
darcy made no answer.	65.50731125387365
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam.	459.7616451449423
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	900.3266455552986
i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	280.43223000516565
* * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	477.05520780151807
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	532.7911704977016
how i long to see her!	170.0035422532867
they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	907.5560402000285
"i do not get on at all.	61.428087909478414

every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	736.730201747041
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	451.6561397864541
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."	278.6144980428774
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	127.65739835536615
i can hardly write for laughing.	180.2429606494562
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	550.8668177245872
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	528.4268559578095

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	206.38460521312842
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	642.4016449703278
but my dear lydia, i don't at all like your going such a way off.	425.9544889488684
"but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	291.57826289613723
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	357.2103751770928
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.	717.4522632001301
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is too far off!	536.8495986784023
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained.	560.3697483175076
you have sense, and we all expect you to use it.	276.4455995708635

as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him!	445.3646567458994
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.	276.04864054541565
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	366.3836160460447

her ease and good spirits increased.	227.67892562458917

"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."	263.1918546684518
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above.	400.2932067609902
he now wished it more than ever.	208.1982128539963
"of music!	71.5301167301449
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy."	354.3878213400845
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you.	317.07929276774354
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	875.7698661363271
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	289.50809230465285
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	316.9638559566891
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	361.2100411766112
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	630.3251018668981
but as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.	309.2774292253046
one ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	281.8437800164816
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	612.5497828318682
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "let me call your maid.	576.446660997791
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	481.0290884149509
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued absence.	440.44510513094787
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips.	300.23707251090894
he danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	665.8089938541634
why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	583.2067924980965
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair."	433.94180273743086
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."	205.30927974920593
but i can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."	547.9846698982565
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	652.5837923646914
this was agreed to, and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	611.222744906927
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	537.5685601376238
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be certain.	387.7126369804776
the first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.	649.9699357792806
i dearly love a laugh."	120.14586241915359
on mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.	506.86866791540103
that such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."	503.29618586100156
single, my dear, to be sure!	164.4323544441631
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	267.32924163131776
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	278.6703975029543

if he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.	309.4975114340478
"nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley.	76.50743242414667
section 1.	57.391444475601546
elizabeth now began to revive.	183.4457870168586
yes;--there is nothing in that.	175.1726175525071
have you had any flirting?	240.7718720193132
he owns it himself without disguise."	158.60582618507289
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	747.0940220482205
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	390.00947831738614
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."	291.18231128347657
mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	519.52824270904
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life.	532.6049656963974
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	641.2715547572849
i shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	449.8057869171822
"eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds.	447.54242981039914
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	635.470197205754
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	723.556960976075
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can dance."	392.95050447591166
other schemes too came into her head.	341.1059299513006
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.	379.56493802527575
"you look pale.	69.32264084745717
mr darcy bowed.	68.20785046808548
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	502.56870386508024
"design!	57.35399169648249
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	629.4878467742415
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.	674.7786663367499
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	307.8413149051249
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again."	343.37116707391397
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	572.3521695458934
what are you telling miss bennet?	190.95659831261068
the least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	671.5850677249908
but i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	239.52355514152623
at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	678.8741188521614
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	402.5525316680016
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew more affection than she feels.	641.4327710288113
and his sisters are charming women.	193.08577416467648
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.	287.54631996776
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	397.117432428057
darcy mentioned his letter.	133.11307155325866
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	557.7903934163107
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	628.8476901643141
the visit was returned in due form.	227.60325864940063
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	123.0823431196272
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	589.9349270212793
it is almost past belief.	117.24298214991175
but now suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	788.3361416779777
the miss webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--do you draw?"	399.2200585024622
no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	635.0149765808773
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	479.11921216398036
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."	332.8237837667077
you had much better dance."	116.6761561741792
chapter vii.	49.077036267764335
"can you come to-morrow?"	93.19223951103662
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	231.26747579041836
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	281.592631481553
it was only said, 'lately, george wickham, esq.	306.8999257721097
it will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."	413.83823390878877
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	461.5618180037132
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."	254.56530609941726
but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	522.1209738025392
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	186.53665927798463
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	417.9476042014366
secondly, that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	694.1962428668822
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	617.1264516247819
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	474.52448852024156
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked.	253.2048904802476
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	420.98466976656084
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	611.7264108779405
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and mrs hurst was observing their game.	465.03063211766766
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?"	394.4830339747464
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	105.05492388533663
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	432.94706374641174
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	129.59268777502606
another day i will do the same; i will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	754.5488186444574
he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; charlotte tried to console her.	472.79556784253066
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	543.15660320567
of his former way of life, nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	639.3583024764357
mr bingley followed his advice.	136.36509062102581
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.	540.160191088662
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	321.8573937423394
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	374.87755549000894
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	533.3308934259911
he added, that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and promised to write again very soon.	444.1073265037251
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern.	368.429021910066
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	447.37284319736233
i know not what to think.	72.82216817590225
"i am trying to make it out."	64.3093419030721
"none at all.	54.2636983836407
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	553.1233319675529
she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	462.91411962727176
mr darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!	478.84309528328043
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."	390.7083139321936
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking.	358.0283708031755
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	262.4626443979781
but i know the foundation is unjust.	203.7692100393252
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	276.148855860855
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	524.7175969651068
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."	390.4651749327056
"and they must marry!	92.02365562269767
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	412.45856524742976
indeed, eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."	245.53638102983984
does he know his real character?"	231.59472334137467
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	168.36718929223306
though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	419.03315791315197
she replied in the affirmative.	179.12732154084617
at night she opened her heart to jane.	283.63272350043235
what a fine thing for our girls!"	207.87039628612845
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	307.77830168463737
but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	311.86589510924546
i know no harm of her."	73.96543847629665
"ah!	34.78074896461365
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and i know i appeared distressed.	495.17547626736985
if an individual project gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges.	736.8565819917276
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	487.2677523280737
it is just as he chooses.	141.68909271970358
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.	586.8923741628646
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	666.877468809488
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	191.19493582933376
all field sports were over.	238.35453908381717
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's looks and behaviour.	547.9678634771261
"and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.	346.5073174417685
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	321.308998330049
compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.	514.5075594927164
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	168.987894512763
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	324.5997886544241
but our visitor was very obstinate.	237.51984649861183
he arranges the business just as he pleases."	181.45074245644602
they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.	383.2142219445338
well, well, i only hope it will last.	237.0496060667668
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	132.45162383642847
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	543.1639105615325
"gracechurch-street, monday, august 2.	152.17438851971912
when she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	656.3647940445896
it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you.	373.618973524814
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	480.3883010746699
"yes, she did."	33.70337186586965
"and what is your success?"	76.63430472172665
i owe all that i know of it, to another, not to you."	221.84003976123392
it was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	236.47185580147575
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	679.237657124208
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed.	579.8688760567161
and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."	817.9623157167024
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine about this report?	358.1704584993134
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, i dare say."	149.6068670144506
"gracechurch-street, sept.	109.05929988787229
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	204.7369431992206
it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	334.84324775476676
"beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	497.78669649426325
she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	432.5446417147241
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say nothing of that.	443.37015259323874
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	195.38163521591744
no, no--i feel he may defy us there.	261.024332289455
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	238.14986355387978
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	612.8564800884242
"edw.	57.35399169648249
at present i will say nothing about it."	116.96195750575556
"my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	160.27351462358726
i shall see her in january.	147.30590008261723
it is mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	534.1357007878769
but you have chosen your fault well.--i really cannot laugh at it.	248.8286948330185
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr darcy had much better finish his letter."	216.80147979933304
a small sum could not do all this."	194.57000881957
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	504.44978333456237
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the subject.	197.70410583637937
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	414.427711475846
said charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	133.73171930950454
a house in town!	159.54792350562926
there was no help for it however.	182.01752136897034
and a special licence.	128.91375610496655
lord bless me!	145.55206397951213
she had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	411.9267958455543
"and pray may i ask?"	73.91675193721234
his pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	677.3118738091315
chapter vi.	61.44207151475285
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	507.34627349130506
will you tell me how long you have loved him?"	275.8402429576735
she wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	375.31427121653985
she smiled, but made no answer.	137.6334720442492
i should infinitely prefer a book."	116.07102313701564
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	622.568548136673
unless a copyright notice is included.	368.0740332322707
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	267.67740734078876
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel.	475.4374539026549
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	424.0781398276748
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	306.3582089533765
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	550.7631939402874
it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	439.94301395415374
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	748.521352388113
"and your defect is a propensity to hate every body."	190.98226439690237
"and you saw him frequently?"	106.74149131981338
all was joy and kindness.	220.52992727859672
"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."	387.5875894595049
when denny, and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	475.24203206077215
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	152.66061864842908
what shall we do with him?	234.42880454045786
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	696.2815184395201
by nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at st james's had made him courteous.	587.2489034604891
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.	757.7339853056945
well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss!	261.9572472191097
you are not going to be missish, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	395.6878552278723
"no governess!	56.44224770888624
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	195.74718229296366
she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	427.93960957390897
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	126.54490364255756
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	385.01555856093614
chapter xii.	49.077036267764335
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	193.94863353951547
she is quite a little creature.	162.85753594251017
it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	291.2298365929411
"good heaven!	40.63629438046961
risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."	655.7492101376506
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	567.5703150612323
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.	436.96091651659066
after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	722.9731242016063
if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."	336.4522584120271
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.	502.5100706723034
gardiner."	33.31299353634879
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	254.36799903371877
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	296.5958962762813
mrs bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	686.621422375298
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to mr darcy.	546.7549990183074
oh!	14.346523268075027
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	406.69361100683386
lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	594.9970144194335
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."	253.9268914087004
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"	411.10795092575273
"they will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	352.4420188052645
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	518.2426258550681
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	126.41664128461763
elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.	628.8208815025619
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	800.3085606337035

"oh, jane, take care."	80.40568327481377
after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	821.830625309935
no, never.	95.29428809392165
you know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	500.56657194592043
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	696.2757690327611
"good heaven!	40.63629438046961
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "oh, papa, what news?	551.355270564433
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	575.8161003058282
i wish you had been there.	84.74244984004659
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	575.8206820725429
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	848.6666977272428
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	601.2535779475493
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	662.248633903173
one came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	389.98457793255926
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit.	403.45515019175923
with his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	844.6471962735235
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.	778.8859200559472
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	159.4095792272061
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.	373.838670086715
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	611.9565077802895
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	827.62019645062
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.	458.0919355196031
but, alas!	53.428110895510684
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	642.8396976984411
what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening.	579.5637184230418
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?"	346.66363578160696
mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	348.5218280146646
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	613.4563945088627
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	508.00980749191496
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	710.1751041928719

and mrs forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	658.4433398348381
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	175.5650656265386
but i knew i should persuade you at last.	183.8851321593052
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	651.0289928274665
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	568.1885093659523
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.	895.6287787413547
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	398.1098997425992
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	470.4897248694397
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	611.3692934194598
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"oh!	244.9531954185459
i must speak to hill, this moment."	149.25777534745367
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	508.3699765235447
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	529.5798157337289
"oh!	7.596391247223825
he could even listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james's, with very decent composure.	649.6286004557766
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	497.7713416318519
you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	274.69757820558846
she finds miss pope a treasure.	217.34917239761987
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	562.7884191111574
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	518.0498633088845
you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."	412.71471328731985

he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away.	472.94108999127076
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"	447.64462464578276
he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	508.1128152818023
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	820.4287473241634
let me hear from you very soon.	174.63954803604247

she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	351.7570241014319
"no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."	234.08700731799786
soon after you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were.	645.2194734142238
how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	766.0725958778322
she could think only of her letter.	130.05586072074425
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	316.0649986102568
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	207.9025849423045
her ladyship was highly incensed.	183.22187091532655
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	520.1946048653957
yet, indeed, i am in earnest.	194.86682389745576
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	428.20235222617225
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	245.9634589793297
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.	302.2485604830514
on saturday he came again.	152.42901535264016
it was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	353.0396323686533
her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	382.5487285997002
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	139.06599944624244
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	277.61354537271444
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	341.99626710768325
"oh!	7.596391247223825
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	671.4991934624785
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	144.0937535985958
what hours of transport we shall spend!	323.99758582765594
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet."	222.12191700089045

"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	220.78736382845364
you must not disappoint your father."	93.3176566819855
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	494.6408315808016
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	502.7304144657235
"and so was i."	65.34524477418121
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	325.1529678914228
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	650.9375339261709
but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	691.3623089686308
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	607.0305868603134
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	691.4810052089111
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."	242.7412391736252

i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	521.4282104693239
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	421.6282952383977
pray do not talk of that odious man.	320.7616025916968
i am sick of them all.	72.88741153017821
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	137.17737648134687
i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother.	290.96734825708006
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"	263.7105067621117

there can be no love in all this.	164.23702698252063

it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them both----" "then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	326.5746104023381
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."	194.0852630994514
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."	262.52448583343244
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	394.77756547966237
"good gracious!	36.37999570532283
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her.	748.113798170626
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."	343.72547931194663
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	255.1367131567954
it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.	489.7065090780603
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	652.0308190907169

this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	472.3004656747681
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr darcy then was.	596.9709294119459

"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	206.61851277249818
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object.	344.4538909521275
but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.	510.2778212804512

but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.	528.8794924241357
"very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--but now we may be silent."	372.61031503150457
vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	665.6364811074242
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did mrs bennet give up the point.	356.4572773074872
while she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	624.6193817497139
but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you are satisfied."	434.0348968105939
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	628.7110600040127
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.	222.10644969789902
they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.	684.3843469502843

in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	483.16246223204996

the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	428.71913800655716
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.	704.5967124930773

mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	862.977438297704
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	676.1578077821305
i am prodigiously proud of him.	69.8807000165215
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	110.57117560664494
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	373.65578879136956
he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."	270.7490990086936
perhaps there was some truth in this; though i doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event.	877.0849179302628
i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	294.6019452444584
"i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said darcy.	185.7260795579448
"from mr collins!	75.04318628449936
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	719.2341371062087
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	557.4015502245998
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley.	450.5488519114599
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	628.4471717555984
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	496.58459432038404
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	519.3847321437621
where shall you change horses?--oh!	213.08697775184442
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great books, and make extracts."	461.4235158936912
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	601.3640591213012

mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	469.35691303084155
"dining out," said mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky."	88.81519676428485

"that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance.	432.9345535687162
but, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."	412.4887546833704
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly.	276.6199932243806
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property."	304.9695342474849
and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son?	657.6584739995285
"dear lizzy!"	58.056530188890044
you may ask questions, which i shall not choose to answer."	210.7364550519405
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	565.5022200950876
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	407.0121037701957
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	408.0441629503655
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	495.9524490841067
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	425.7398384995679
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	374.48720767899823
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy, she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	595.6214428063383
"i have, sir."	30.597402232828735
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	402.06060923137375
"what, none of you?"	90.04179054370424
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham.	542.8600783047908
they are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	591.7734796854023
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	357.5742956001022
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."	492.1247861053883
"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	198.43016319423808
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	129.90417448520284
"i am not one and twenty."	51.05999282203508
i am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	215.64538390598022
she was overpowered by shame and vexation.	146.1508998080851
as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth."	573.0737294908455
"you have said quite enough, madam.	152.00659800491968
it cannot be.	48.53835357554665
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	206.40131990866934
in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	574.8855638768217
the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness!	484.9034857826405
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham, and rejoiced in it.	252.88279572735377
we have heard nothing from town."	148.46612535543844
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	397.6755321390789
"upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield.	421.33404127844994
"oh!"	13.041208659043962
i did not expect such a compliment."	102.63286335706736
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."	506.1537810912722
elizabeth replied that it was.	84.38780232574862
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time.	212.01340972942083
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	366.06967832240286
lydia came to us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	375.26091736375787
"how good it was in you, my dear mr bennet!	193.33207756509526
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.	699.3740438534836
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	565.6954781682597
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	93.83366658679576
i did not know before, that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony.	266.9716984982116
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	683.5862538598723
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	612.2369412198743
the comfort to her, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	347.6964410420676
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that i am not to be trifled with.	227.02149795753684
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton.	872.2500710813007
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	327.28034228625
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	623.0083283201529
cried elizabeth.	24.868521698769708
but we are all liable to error.	203.02301268535987
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	441.094152088173
but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	852.4488289582407
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	458.0635195581302
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	970.4717701370614
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	285.4398506736363
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	506.77025446749775
i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from you.	314.8606309074701
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	421.39114070069206
mr darcy!--and so it does i vow.	155.0999845748382
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."	199.83628368066152
chapter ix.	61.44207151475285
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	443.9747925331686
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	690.7369418136243
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	646.4304924534887
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?"	417.2020202184272
at least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."	277.46157341182254
haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	601.7416935400404
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	734.5448081058004
howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.	633.3952605112455
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	186.9208316038979
if you are a good girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of them."	321.4525167543925
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, "do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	406.34853644588264
only look at her.	99.04126966067318
in spite of having been at st james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	686.1206230702218
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	768.3318139684517
but, lizzy!	39.513443959345146
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	354.5469299010734
dear lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	380.95017546367586
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	689.0661936812967
the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	475.2690617967992
i cannot think so very ill of wickham.	137.45221931353746
but in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	335.20463180683464
did you see him while you were at lambton?	406.96671477742007
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede.	433.1967483133066
i am sure you must feel it so."	81.8816562691405
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror.	496.58911684857367
oh, sister!	102.50168467587856
it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	500.408553762483
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	276.0579089988851
cried he, turning towards her.	143.47640658186737
see paragraph 1.e below.	202.0787402587435
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	161.74506366462816
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	568.705456503586
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate.	712.1998697898
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	308.1212414169065
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	409.3367459098368
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	318.36265665896417
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it."	385.55024781267934
"dear sir, "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	241.82395833834934
how odious i should think them!"	190.1519061606757
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	422.5247434656889
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	302.55571589435533
you know him too well to doubt the rest.	250.55529093132589
it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire.	591.9909483288046
at length, she spoke again.	116.01810133976572
what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"	260.56223429566904
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.	695.3202758872561
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	211.77810833948857
"i am sure there is not on his.	92.78074826251422
elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.	320.6500509179312
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	831.907235120935
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point.	303.5370461769213
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.	398.86073159588864
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time.	429.736727927568
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	520.1599553251499
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.	439.9862810229811
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know."	345.38569629914605
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	251.6108168882669
mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding.	399.2312221521882
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	459.6119796977353
i have not been accustomed to such language as this.	157.6641328350089
"complied with!	82.81343051998857
one day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	557.0683051917266
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	462.03649773990236
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	383.89756677677855
i quite forgot!	92.45604198941808
we neither of us perform to strangers."	184.86678571865104
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	257.52851444370935
mr collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.	687.3969410760101
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.	453.6143762992687
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.	512.429939513842
if you'll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight.	448.0869174498887
"your's, &c."	42.80362101041118
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	128.01634649493866
"and my mother--how is she?	174.74988224119897
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	495.022362066262
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	879.6339814292301
she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	729.2901547965199
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	696.2248529458782
but it was not to be.	44.57673274015809
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	634.4255229028911
people did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true.	432.3158501077686
cried lydia.	64.68018467222335
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	681.9751478883896
but that is one great difference between us.	189.98001625685978
"you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	355.2528495220357
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for us.	180.67827340189362
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	545.9799737706801
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	538.98877724193
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's."	599.1871248010877
it was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.	173.6082842427252
well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone.	572.7426362384134
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.	219.62750944796852
"i know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder.	216.33934660319593
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	829.0229613169389
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	449.1420270159002
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	533.5753722335301
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	145.54756115945693
"from the former.	74.65633448853762
but my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of, that i may have it to-morrow."	438.65482798488114
i promised them so faithfully!	185.95918612526185
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	447.3688102854672
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	397.96025419630763
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you certain?	204.9789977284418
my father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	151.9231752844495
who should suffer but myself?	270.85062195153756
mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	458.25856239097857
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	257.77492039769135
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.	977.5390818988235
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	275.190919360308
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr hurst had a house.	828.9726724190324
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	423.28459615234755
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?	285.79902856572716
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	271.72637902593067
your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	378.42812527140154
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.	370.693761822252
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	311.7205192827888
your daughter elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land."	666.9209813293096
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.	410.7257767227794
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	630.6814972609643
"the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	291.673929851003
i will leave him to himself."	93.04022034199535
lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."	728.2311198232649
she cried.	29.497010214990077
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	117.24321284786453
not handsome enough to dance with!	187.6763076430199
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."	355.236302545389
"indeed i could not.	58.70903858475845
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	638.6596435391162
let us hope for better things.	212.5646607815738
what do i not owe you!	208.2379420317585
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time."	432.3256810797835
"the party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	361.77853528712416
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	230.76283780188217
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	735.6028753037939
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets (example: m^{rs}).	712.9370887445236
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	286.82568938232276
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	126.54490364255756
my mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she says.	461.4409753240635
"certainly not; at first.	125.90744442753386
she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids.	651.3612224311884
yes.	42.5794842421969
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs bennet, alarmed.	214.68623821501316
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	288.0091072869515
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	297.51073107159704
i must beg to return to the house."	118.30666812607923
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable house.	415.0963373730997
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."	301.4738633901209
all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the london road.	444.7393591801924
on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	717.7615630747981
through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	699.1102289737772
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater beauty.	255.79966275607742
i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however, and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	542.4169137988921
mrs hurst thought the same, and added, "she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.	483.6542386680535
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	294.6188190887338
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	232.20300054530173
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."	186.8195395336668
the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	617.0311893600243
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	646.8635457550696
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	233.28230828001634
"oh!	7.596391247223825
but he is an ugly fellow!	174.183085015626
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.	366.3896779215968
"where is your sister?"	103.35106123673708
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	398.1876317793712
my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	631.584656025178
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."	473.3747882913507
the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.	608.0094366521732
"no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."	270.9823489409897
she repeated.	67.05703385624516
but she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	940.7004869454288
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	805.2557839750158
let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner.	617.0602993124548
she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	316.98403738581203
and what can he have to say?"	129.36334516872716
"and i certainly never shall give it.	106.93524873269425
"if it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	273.4302087229806
it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	717.0623961038236
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	495.98957291354765
"probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses.	313.739176023679
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	575.2483185880195
by this time she is actually with them!	341.539324718216
having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	681.3813375149838
she studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	535.9748768532371
when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	353.2686350791064
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	696.989276377088
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.	350.46761477165506
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	375.36777270457515
"oh, yes!	34.330518776694525
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	227.96140797099605
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	744.2363663137413
at our time of life, it is not so pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.	530.1506501359968
hear me in silence.	234.78175887959878
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	655.3712611280577
"such as vanity and pride."	104.97628525406033
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	244.45240874278798
"if you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	206.88883516801073
but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years.	659.4222357011398
had the late mr darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	663.5002101160948
"no, indeed.	43.28788375728284
"and they are really to be married!"	131.35329809851493
"oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.	250.18988821134886
i thought we never should have got into the coach.	282.81400212499716
mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	538.3082254375682
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	200.09130689569122
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked up.	466.14369765060894
he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.	504.0657886169095
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "well, jane, who is it from?	379.31257875318227
he was angry.	66.12830679573645
miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	531.9523647123185
"what could become of mr bingley and jane!"	121.90640370703586
she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	266.93678377117277
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	406.08692626434924
"money!	57.35399169648249
had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	722.6947213188112
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	676.5653967733919
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	507.0728762975081
i do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body better looking.	407.1995504079372
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	124.1098325097672
at length the parsonage was discernible.	209.21004673066167
this is your final resolve!	170.87822601599717
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i am excessively attentive to all those things.	557.7011778720255
as for jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	701.7250101382987
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	201.57507416120794
how i wanted you!"	110.44916436428943
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it."	164.93885873005786
mr wickham began the subject himself.	137.01225446778224
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	665.1130865305304
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.	463.2306711313682
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes."	384.0181821620481
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should."	186.46176488013788
she declared her resolution.	146.1644040581556
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, "mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	552.0697692286495
had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	518.0851117869945
she shook her head.	82.6812557648237
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	691.327726545201
she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	747.9741094781739
i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	401.818775298027
let me do it without farther loss of time.	254.56438039089156
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i do remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	430.43773891100784
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	173.56199781263956
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	916.9448563434223
i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	265.4723736523362
"it is well.	32.53639754627167
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."	244.7282880078056
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves?	505.25513340883526
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	782.9380255984606
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."	271.8089100541038
but mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.	550.0118186763224
there he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.	279.9860565618544
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	728.9230278482845
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	607.031634604682
to donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate section 5.	263.3230383288109
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there.	561.8944560259814
jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	556.7394866235206
"yes, almost every day."	51.84651959007862
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!"	422.88803886827094
i came to try you.	107.64657712216327
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.	794.2710062169725
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long.	294.52671763360587
has she any family?"	167.28066800529052
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."	390.63208296131074
it is impossible for me to be impartial.	136.24069985598604
observed mrs bennet.	127.38699050417323
the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	248.27523660063397
her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	745.4431614182815
that is the place to get husbands.	253.71534777098563
oh!	14.346523268075027
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man."	374.3315552237644
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	469.46806579986816
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.	597.0190204759953
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	213.66101920952278
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	686.0562234003118
but however he did not.	84.66126435653064
as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	538.5832051022757
he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."	387.36987209069474
mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	590.3315301929648
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	606.30084872165
do you often dance at st james's?"	206.94547930571514
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	494.3282657361773
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	299.73608347257885
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	521.0056000394387
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.	429.5476307066594
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	193.9099145618396
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?"	461.1022478869837
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	585.4111100596557
mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last.' she did indeed.	307.2642739505564
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	654.7575424277549
"that is very strange.	63.415352707898315
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	467.625013384056
this room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	586.7898482655775
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	274.01364381067685
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	463.22585301763917
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."	371.14071329772753
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford.	394.266508192986
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	834.8388023963016
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you.	462.6836204172638
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	954.2668799036959
but at least it shews, that she was serious in the object of her journey.	303.06660428318816
mr wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return.	358.68171508957573
the vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have.	672.5389926687534
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	591.8238377538186
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."	620.2993592667652
if i was to go through the world, i could not meet with a better.	299.81710433236293
"yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing.	231.8673225934928
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	410.0652633195265
in that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	582.6026693667027
she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	520.111041564996
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	499.5533663211807
i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character."	354.1072371397417
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	731.7072037051882
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.	725.0178291327493
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	515.3363930224766
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well."	285.3536453763401
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	105.11514641294058
"do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?	480.04345354635285
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	441.86248416503264
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	214.15276228423798
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	520.8222219316222
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	376.63677792687236
it will pass away soon enough."	139.6363018714957
"what would she have said?--how would she have behaved?"	164.95450010049382
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	371.3826401517178
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	601.4939472223748
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	294.64015309664313
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	682.2383372278367
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.	353.0015364294506
she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	278.3180432726774
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."	421.0933763485658
he drew a chair near her.	154.2234873390926
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	438.16322492595253
and what sort of young lady is she?	219.75712413257608
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	517.4465399039459
do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	407.4930297893793
for what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"	579.4219867592791
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature.	488.1948006689401
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	764.1933032501425
"i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	452.47012044296173
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	411.8164155909384
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."	553.6077802292789
i must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	301.5097229360871
it was to this effect: "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.	514.9077135605453
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	377.2186328910362
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	842.5348432468456
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself.	376.0902134232026
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	610.4883918095678
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	584.7513364254759
they were in ---- street.	89.12422658151863
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.	685.4913802549573
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	392.2628629703362
in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.	536.0695671951318
he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	413.5212395636672
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	704.2305785857477
"no, my dear; i think not.	105.32847748099307
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge.	656.1430595394445
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--i shall not be able to keep you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.	501.07153388679563
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	538.756615530352
her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	406.9873351221718
it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	296.89960416113564
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	683.6699308733355
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	111.06181885423749
they came.	69.0377896934069
"yours, &c."	46.207043373628466
very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	782.8179650558203
those who do not complain are never pitied."	288.15534180722466
a low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	417.11709383626163
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	185.51634044669322
why does she not come in?"	225.32832435421216
we have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	1014.5823728446672
lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy.	554.792012458784
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."	413.514118272546
how i laughed!	111.60494664031225
he is gone to my father already.	185.41569213441525
chapter iv.	61.44207151475285
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	88.17161100819322
such a disappointment!	133.44683697066134
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	188.56847053581907
have not you always hated him?"	195.06347597273256
i felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	520.3529214055055
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	434.6947188921508
she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	341.4972059675673
oh!	14.346523268075027
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	738.6763493079383
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."	209.8993220515006
"and have you answered the letter?"	111.77031657980366
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	475.85862127361565
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	628.9048165969159
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	266.40369723723603
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	598.5500262137185
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon.	277.34586932801915
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	548.3953759940568
i send no compliments to your mother.	185.9298118044138
everything wore a happier aspect.	357.52107378428406
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	469.89718958645966
if he had another motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him.	214.53748673583942
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged.	730.764491195713
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	382.50313693398846
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	281.77026734841706
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh.	565.4464897736958
on both sides it was only assertion.	260.4383593771839
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	580.3974930478183
do not let us quarrel about the past.	290.79649114354515
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	759.4776878864426
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	890.2166766169671
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	610.6201000948477
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	754.432879146325
mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	496.4767534907805
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	856.5227937698961
what say you, mary?	231.13046198567497
"oh!	7.596391247223825
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	786.8547873074323
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	266.12986756117476
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.	660.4307390572474
she liked him too little to care for his approbation.	331.9604655630821
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr bingley."	259.9747648843539
"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.	221.60923897713926
oh, lord!	60.37386893326079
i know your disposition, lizzy.	116.99893229855164
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1.	263.1409781631582
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better.	433.20635564907883
she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	612.2953801395191
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	607.0229510423852
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	665.3593570799239
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	159.0237946215462
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	360.64802586217485
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	155.54985486434762
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	104.97051952431559
you will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	313.1181346325659
w.	63.468596081134955
dear me!	94.48370999056056
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	532.7627039693642
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	643.8942299444924
chapter ix.	61.44207151475285
i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy.	614.9135947452223
this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	393.7510045445064
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	764.5663300329302
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that i should be looked at.	328.96368888174266
"how can you talk so?"--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate."	340.186815692216
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	520.3047414465824
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"	483.9123605671828
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	196.72024542451902
though lydia's short letter to mrs f.	278.1623609632617
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	414.8591095903877
let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	618.5896921328218
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out."	421.60695694469484
but these things happen so often!	221.14384131747298
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	677.9420965091348
he was on one side of her mother.	120.36421813815744
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?	424.72985332157384
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	317.8665644654423

he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	283.4749142998177
must it be so?"	169.02926487044212
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	197.69263103189053
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	548.0536354542413
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	389.6404570453823
not that i am afraid of myself, but i dread other people's remarks."	248.09784865632912
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	511.41516123667054
chapter xv.	49.077036267764335
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	649.5417983792087
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel fitzwilliam.	307.04050789668446

when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	289.24910313380815
after this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	436.51191838618973
my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you write for me.	320.09178360186377
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	243.136832512274
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	546.112759737579
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	168.94439762307098
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."	454.44107915338924
"what can be the meaning of this!"	114.96278779717359
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	759.8107623983859
"yes," thought elizabeth, "that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	266.2536687819506
"mr darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	348.2139087118947

"i have heard from authority, which i thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	300.60746805854734
be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.	752.530050619001

"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said elizabeth.	272.5893304438925
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.	876.8673133360429
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	207.27019611918539
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, "i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	382.3243571083997

well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley.--but--good lord!	192.22857910066176
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	700.9025602313349
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party.	280.89424567559564
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	685.7344783056552

instead of viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	475.98285833385603

"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	451.15368350354925

"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said elizabeth.	178.33759422687035
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do."	507.9742404342211
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	883.8468671678614

to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough.	352.4508032477499
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.	341.9305870354436
i quite detest the man."	93.16710950638888
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	320.42217397010864
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master.	518.8874940353613
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	225.8740737035415
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	151.22629318934722
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	273.0440847838125
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	472.2281577065634

she was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	654.9139575807388

though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, "i am not."	370.56395054251897

mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	571.0818843762147
they were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	320.56464289769724
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	845.6006636237098
what a good joke it will be!	160.14775394332523
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	812.0814233575729
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	619.9134023519885
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	933.8739814975888
she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	781.3570682204423

you see on what a footing we are.	306.71236707548815
you give me fresh life and vigour.	282.23226484550486
you tear them to pieces."	134.22582605158888
elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley.	831.6643535698234
it seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	723.6939464817781
well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."	347.030536370725
and so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?	341.0732476766274
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	645.8789459550534
and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."	529.2829162663631
it was really a very handsome thought.	140.072255533753
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	135.93494086032902
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	674.759241898137
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen pemberley."	254.47144201069617
yes, there was something in that; i told you so from the first, you may remember."	377.5788773644618
how much you must have gone through!"	185.96222535652078
"you shall have it in few words.	176.18627339221533
"no, nothing at all."	41.775027272740516
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	440.6574386788052
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	261.86827850883714
cried elizabeth.	24.868521698769708
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	271.0195231278081
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley.	270.82597459649844
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.	335.6161244093147
but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."	370.0231455026151
the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy.	166.57267380494716
"you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	222.79214721901548
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	144.92096290250453
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	412.83918791849277
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	170.59841973960536
in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	796.003162890057
you must not suspect me.	81.99937758241559

mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--mr bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	854.1896710784707
said her aunt.	98.34864445134266
"he brought it with him for us to see."	183.67774398553215
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.	531.4910383358399

"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	335.8103852550461
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	648.7378064500707
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."	465.6511905031514
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	608.8999446214361
my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself.	538.8338862181189
you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	358.4112065209374
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	746.2554755192399
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	285.8411479185494
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	587.13485017529
how is half such a sum to be repaid?"	301.51216302273616
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	829.2769191212785
it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	205.81340818298574
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	402.6819922771153
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	478.56754281368325
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	734.7985681027653
with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	650.7669445922307
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.	903.7603270937252
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	167.25656572698364
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	358.9324279617904
i mend pens remarkably well."	99.16237814819415
"oh, lord!	31.26703337732679
"what is there of good to be expected?"	156.90848787846525
her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	648.7978580646752
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	262.7388191110394
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	917.7401136814518
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.	505.1553790816343
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	471.9212944825573
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	795.5345002677595
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	585.766477275119
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	315.6705620591377
a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	442.1375635334987
but who was your mother?	178.8693076008762
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	239.91580355298527
mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	714.6401357934535
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself.	365.9320012737443
oh!	14.346523268075027
"oh, lord!	31.26703337732679
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me.	572.6445144809344
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	722.1151462279234
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	140.60303461827795
- you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm license.	662.7598552304378
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any better."	365.21102923024785
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention.	337.52164886812744
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	713.6369087393289
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	182.95084471556711
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	441.04589920078394
besides, there was truth in his looks."	269.5333285219623
he had to be sure done much.	124.01389844487952
"i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk to oakham mount this morning.	205.80208770393986
her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	332.65063047921205
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	256.6383186327786
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	160.8683944753211
"oh, no!"	43.57433621208354
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	535.4735143507976
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	166.2306532631732
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	526.1758512549853
said mr gardiner.	126.00369564752764
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	361.58607232013594
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	193.38098317036037
i am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	313.9126708403706
"something very much to the purpose of course.	198.5559857611135
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	814.6793728658758
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	429.3165381004673
they will have nothing else to do."	98.33812048337191
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	442.32393655277406
it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	279.4764143374018
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	175.0208248724027
it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."	430.19436175287905
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	414.17819796417956
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	604.6479575168127
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard.	757.2074493275807
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance.	547.3568597311157
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at pemberley.	322.11783089311547
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	458.62994718713935
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.	729.0321481328785
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	562.8768298416192
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	328.53377338003077
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	201.79656553577877
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	778.3366614848695
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	729.9844613685701
"i can easily believe it.	53.84703547709651
1.e.4.	30.002190201055924
1.f.	40.84558532978047
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	515.6334096621948
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	678.5286622215237
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	250.99478875569255
but her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	316.12385177326564
but i have other provocations.	104.0930840994659
and so did mrs forster.	164.29265269361926
she shall hear my opinion."	113.97147176703332
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	304.9862103111966
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	269.1010148819927
"you are quite right.	49.97024024722711
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.	414.92412964981924
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	627.3733337513436
"you can now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	225.662916632809
does she live near you, sir?"	212.75977262501902
i was sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	445.87832019260657
"already arisen!"	73.05159505069975
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."	712.4496441041383
"my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	293.7467611295565
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	233.80221007827095
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	187.6601847208194
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	214.9821802191417
my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	803.2438151569404
chapter xi.	49.077036267764335
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	849.8210351617081
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	66.63544382528549
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance.	473.5572223893216
i am sure my sisters must all envy me.	142.93501600798604
he was full of joy and attention.	162.8953499029831
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	237.86990433884677
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	238.34178860904842
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	755.2537229050448
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	320.47302106559323
but it is of small importance."	78.42898581199299
and do you really love him quite well enough?	330.82366292845495
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	255.27055776452139
cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."	561.0711338378994
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	619.4251340479143
they were natural and just.	143.40675365706156
allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."	629.4522801585932
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	378.48147624828084
but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	332.65363442236554
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	72.2850002964898
since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been his design.	801.9592065997097
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.	818.0641896606135
he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."	334.15474973407714
my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	284.48032986237075
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	214.94550804457793
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings.	296.8013560435526
her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	529.0515216938438
her father lifted up his eyes.	184.33108747536664
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, "lizzy, i never gave you an account of my wedding, i believe.	454.3700470653971
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	470.56866164751557
sir william only smiled.	156.11555368325497
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty.	274.5508013704108
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	225.44601709355948
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	510.50193816563745
had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"	693.9508428294441
chapter iii.	46.489774947193354
you are a gentleman's daughter.	117.37633548605812
there was one part especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again.	411.3875764940869
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together.	331.660106075744
lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia.	539.1960229290496
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	321.8485017525415
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	616.6120143656195
is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?	399.66756683719035
"oh!	7.596391247223825
"it will be her turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	194.7457323229742
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	257.7509905223461
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	486.18451573841014
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.	864.7051997242629
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."	554.6943074995909
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet.	734.0139070797568
we can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	727.7005123832377
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.	291.9677819989524
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent.	558.6756869711692
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	530.282991882771
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be angry."	280.96725744636154
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	612.5372705994246
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	172.60819684960643
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	637.1077412670023
"i am sorry it went off.	76.4451271647799
their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	827.346591229719
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield.	724.6275143644358
its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	790.2231659032471
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, i am determined.	282.9187443702109
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord, how tired i am!"	694.2352350483761
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too much.	223.59457313356884
"but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."	437.98462643591057
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant.	348.83286943202603
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	247.18803337470018
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	489.60600150870613
i was ready to die of laughter.	180.5144708574138
"and do you really know all this?"	102.67524338506932
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "oh!	352.4037154711642
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn.	415.55417272944396
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	543.8182317140513
"what is his name?"	71.52426687577275
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	834.6405567912552
but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?"	229.9255359668986
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet mr darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	714.598494251051
"if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	570.8776911069903
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	472.30790637756814
allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, (glancing at her sister and bingley,) shall take place.	597.631722807411
from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him.	532.6492247639981
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.	804.5835526191078
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	123.47139752281701
you have liked many a stupider person."	155.64145786260477
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	624.9434349018386
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	354.46387343709176
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	222.09969635146876
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	142.1072994700451
much as i abominate writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any consideration.	445.5390953435573
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	846.0020778035893
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	478.2731173945938
chapter v.	61.44207151475285
it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	372.7121476514769
but i make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	298.37576246583757
find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.' allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	603.8441349378302
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.	722.2593507921572
you mentioned two instances.	164.05728048916467
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	416.3631968286161
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!	494.5630045861002
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."	617.0793069335906
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	247.1031386893642
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	976.9451250995064
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	132.95361856260283
that he should have been in love with her for so many months!	229.88436302108943
that abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	375.606152451024
he never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too.	797.9569696606942
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	630.2722059255154
"i had much rather go in the coach."	129.51846588500032
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	611.1699877506686
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	907.8104301204463
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.	594.322621966495
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	130.9917728862548
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	496.02267575606146
his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	584.5375119047943
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	186.94570728384667
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	374.41272412753347
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	249.7437488982345
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	481.57143856799735
her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	562.753860515384
he was silent.	37.57188320567602
i will have no reserves from you."	88.27809147738293
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	341.26433415747346
you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	458.4787819445002
having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	982.763156548796
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	166.60100206981298
"very, very much.	69.77872474725935
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in the north.	350.6731884308258
lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	536.6420062492627
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that."	173.85081660966455
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."	410.3792374995667
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	658.2435466878424
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.	452.9057301361655
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.	262.826608637879
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	150.1973640104042
but it is so strange!"	78.84666329089995
good bye."	60.13131305118091
