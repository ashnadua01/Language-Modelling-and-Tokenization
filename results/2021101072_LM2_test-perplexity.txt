elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	661.9223993940609
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	273.5591878236161
the effect was immediate.	824.8433564860059
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	173.67268262648162
and you saw the old housekeeper, i suppose?	355.05421960897667
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	197.52649715958037

but if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	740.5825006298908
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	365.4789747477331
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	123.28549595032156

the church ought to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."	123.62892046368995
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh!	87.5749427328649
i cannot find out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	72.62956476650554
his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	134.67767063835305
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	365.8754846792074
dear me!	544.4101222697598
at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	100.78482787766147
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he wants you in the library."	108.77417136417122
his debts are to be paid, amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.	295.7714280738575
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	311.9636278362543
his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	415.2749266254496
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"	260.0005633395306
their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	148.43640551924184
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	555.3643770413782
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	393.6866858497462
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	842.7601642780357
chapter ii.	494.93800552600936
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"	309.00069512953417
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing."	483.99210380354543
"la!"	303.15355149565056
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	115.29136609977321
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia," said she, "though i am not her particular friend.	105.21408111115973
but what is that to me?	246.13516624601024
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was her, i would not have put up with it.	160.14783161943868
"indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	243.76205855394153
his marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "wished they might be happy."	181.39279566347295
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	269.13433693428215
"you write uncommonly fast."	1077.2745712966218
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament.	1218.8667873266847
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	224.23330570355725

but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	192.83599013720442
i rather wonder now at your knowing any."	527.4414605410149
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	180.9144604548966
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	188.15041153292543
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.	438.981703908155
the day passed much as the day before had done.	176.175834680686
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	244.50298693259455
before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	219.64821134874595
besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."	213.51764355830008
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	170.11481730365065
she will make him a very proper wife."	278.5346538058777
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."	140.7143379374836
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable."	86.92247914586466
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	396.3973404300066
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	378.5399275828596
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"	157.4183497778859
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	461.0085565213163
by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	240.75605356314605
you will be a very happy woman."	120.38844507798534
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	757.4097934376492
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	2041.5899773419317
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."	112.6677023321972
said he, as he joined her.	164.52835172128792
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.	615.0235846976151
why was he to be the judge?"	430.27833909786915
see paragraph 1.c below.	278.5316928374748
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	196.82358534696775
but i must tell you how it went off.	105.72129440324203
"yes; but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	192.3189354013395
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	300.54033627452696
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	554.9342934562386
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	113.37252500317555
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?"	109.79381329287303
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	359.6550460681732
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with."	65.40531139698068
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	919.7497102427793
sir, i do indeed.	319.07181162823633
"you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	77.04096781194521
i shall now know how to act.	356.51386700418624
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins.	827.3163533472652
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	324.79778694602606
oh!	714.3130208232782
this matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."	320.25497206363286
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	141.44332932066155
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	656.5151652593356
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	590.5853171819098
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	883.5922324949317
chapter xviii.	440.93963481431535
but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	1525.0541287211006
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	373.84042969061477
but, lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	99.26196042265839
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	375.39896917197825
the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	503.37568024973876
i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	2411.8990235852343
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town."	196.6868039187529
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	345.35128401813466
wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly sisters.	257.4875558523098
you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."	453.68510419596555
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	717.9706195614939
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	1315.1602773639079
lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	182.40102425270973
i will put on my things in a moment.	421.87507766299103
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	146.48824762392988
"i have sent for you on an affair of importance.	396.41802794352986
are the others coming out?"	535.0857006595588
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility, "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."	84.08609172479059
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	967.5488488572572
you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	119.7892207386004
it adds even another motive.	2075.7144940317944
how was that possible?	1324.479508813676
these were the contents: "my dear harriet, "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am missed.	182.8724558403618
mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	355.57177880010164
for about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.	223.4429436533735
her mind was less difficult to develope.	2021.6703670164238
jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	1275.1449464536458
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	557.2127410289152
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	175.56588047124123
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in."	255.5604595207422
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	67.87361835431462
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly."	162.6006900368849
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	1060.5363216511362
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	225.19159474771212
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	475.85757549600595
and when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.	252.5576677772726
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."	628.0208379112487
had he done his duty in that respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	303.4810471020652
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham.	191.0663434396775
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	116.71727481735303
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	367.0533950480078
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	339.2068859760675
and one of my own daughters.	251.27986817358936
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	224.7268632702932
very nonsensical to come at all!	976.3307387395281
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	646.4744394286466
* * * * * in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	103.89326488580626

your's, &c.	66.8721791348166
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."	110.51131544867226
you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	506.77425259392976
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	346.7379284675578
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	488.94906806394147
but the clothes, the wedding clothes!	352.6859945961527
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	162.383452586202
elizabeth was delighted.	399.47102086989497
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	130.65607647946703
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	124.8784717395684
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"	96.48154231946123
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	703.3193432039855
chapter vi.	440.93963481431535
mr bennet could not have chosen better.	214.81806794578048
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	129.6361372859121
redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.	19012.188232067823
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him.	239.15858146010888
1.e.	157.60884810798015
no--it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy.	112.9560387902479
hunsford, near westerham, kent, 15 th october.	7226.288458931061
"did not you?	310.44560530642167
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	167.4248750195951
i dare say i shall soon see them here."	178.5673651261195
u.s.	244.2434955962082
said she.	402.44987842688954
this must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	202.39922075002687
chapter xiii.	440.93963481431535
till this moment, i never knew myself."	325.31612342668876
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday.	156.55595508762403
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her.	218.67003453641195
"oh!	271.02234991487614
this was very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	444.425640972594
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	432.9691102425649
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas."	204.63285067315718
their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	212.05789683120176
he placed himself by her.	600.3532142326799
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	968.5765920072746
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	1031.1408198084366
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	593.0354468389924
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	274.77543658275835
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	424.7198117129694
and his answering immediately to the last question--oh!	182.12654982973288
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	3044.244643403609
"no.	524.21231028216

and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	410.49367621833983
they will ruin your happiness.	859.9188676807396
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	112.0895335950835
his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	147.2290001958218
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	128.39913813216
"mrs collins, you must send a servant with them.	102.91378041857824
"sometimes.	977.84508727124
"how i long to see her again!	83.09196015329319
ii.	1590.4176879298043
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.	3636.2156442137025
"my dear brother, "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	117.08263337139482
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	482.5534954851471
and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	221.9381660179161
wickham is safe."	525.8957954034715
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	219.94009078798402
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	617.1894010343073
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."	886.8777702106796
wickham only shook his head.	416.74324716944426
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!	1395.4772786913381
in three volumes.	232.8437795838202
stop me whilst you can."	1146.119569059651
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	113.42463428974565
and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in debt; but i hope this may be false."	264.13900583105584
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	458.0144840789554
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."	335.77687969782846
lady catherine seemed pleased.	249.23033752753847
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	182.28415204120313
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	195.19645878293912
not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	668.9725898435538
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."	86.96794367343415
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in meryton."	105.37517402327668
mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	178.24230125950442
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	1205.6322246033303
"john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	292.8039878718718
but every body is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i assure you.	79.57165170433963
1.f.5.	77.29786367167914
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	197.98946601965778
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	765.8758394000914
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to you."	159.71472927772896
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	120.02424586738368
to the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	213.30132987247956
after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	590.3668119115365
"oh!	271.02234991487614
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned.	168.3812495341774
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added kitty.	56.52585294904348
your mother insists upon your accepting it.	4063.0340450044196
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	148.3052786572501
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	322.42871525382924
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid.	387.009595652603
their manners are not equal to his."	244.071496077748
she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	216.50206013713617
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	351.4651447683504
"how could you begin?"	201.46246888145663
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.	230.85011857568844
mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	132.27929740650958
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	144.2016062667768
without a governess you must have been neglected."	171.35882032346672
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house.	11340.549229023729
"how strange!"	173.58550893727144
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	2056.2963540530127
he is come--mr bingley is come.--he is, indeed.	114.04716367326974
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	923.4554792287223
have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	403.8726712084744
her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.	312.98523798901755
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	309.03769532075063
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."	128.13135031474724
elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.	370.6339797710384
my reasons for believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	416.165760449057
assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.	12010.179769203576
my sisters may write to me.	437.9443627028061
after a short pause, her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	123.71042547267793
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	48.05408981149908
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	1825.627655064493
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative.	276.2045995031946
"i must not decide on my own performance."	242.5604877790929
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley.	120.46736714756383
he did trace them easily to clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.	1494.6411487596517
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."	100.888450812669
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	114.25122394431547
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	58.699187928894546
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, "i can guess the subject of your reverie."	254.86474487010562
it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.	295.0535618178144
i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in mrs jenkinson's room.	136.65839159336244
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	177.62118753030109
his words seemed to imply it.	3572.5296095941744
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	787.6426772746166
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied darcy.	161.4746065488058
the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	823.6401561733422
we all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	744.241633159097
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	263.0935520439955
but i wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	93.25449802638018
"do you really think so?"	156.87190250322564
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	1444.411501379261
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party.	123.4421047212653
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"	112.66848013598938
all that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.	274.6042095693534
when she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister.	212.1453276578558
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	299.61535021578266
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	198.53909672808444
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	64.01662055724273
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?	142.84965518305506
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.	560.107658313886
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	627.6144913503734
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	389.3725279138102
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	2077.8256287205236
i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	46.35074700728843
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what say you to the day?	75.89533820432197
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	2316.439095634561
to know that her daughter would be married was enough.	152.515785453742
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	632.1406674924203
she had very little notice from any but him.	347.543088305517
mr collins made his declaration in form.	949.4299996446365
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	103.98886626109876
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	218.47005428443404
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	73.10085785928474
and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	341.5372576423822
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	150.54920700490848
"i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."	72.50285787106276
i will only add, god bless you.	1429.480537564644
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."	504.83225563330006
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	264.0881345207357
good or bad?"	337.0057581710622
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	369.74137404607796
the hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	1310.6709458647656
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	1120.6097280728093
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	288.00404418861575
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them.	227.905546147884
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.	250.69643915228932
are sufficiently known.	3045.527548952237
mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth, "miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	233.3547162146532
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	225.37980138857557
to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	331.05311213759467
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	279.81607117037237
if she does not object to it, why should we?"	115.6788569292109
we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."	109.20471543952266
1813.	696.3864706516476
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."	106.1035593189795
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.	186.23345487303263
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	298.0289664231377
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!	1273.2421305547127
if he no longer cares for me, why silent?	732.854132040154
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states.	4037.241948028896
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	541.8777679699523
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at longbourn.	315.256969472998
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	588.2249304291721
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	500.25596029410826
* * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	172.51515066069794
make haste, and come down this moment."	155.92243688068336
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it.	422.364287533924
at length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	524.0606471190226
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	389.5176470852586
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.	160.2857480822513
what will wickham say?	1016.4668342532217
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented.	615.7194420166014
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	284.1451760705528
mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.	98.51498639308495
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	140.93881599028185
mr bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	214.59846946792922
i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	235.3901840604035
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	227.670179580773
i.	726.5462381294785
"i do not recollect that we did."	210.31389320828035
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	263.31341560650463
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	232.48760989646723
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	1134.2318970298275
cried lydia.	553.2120099767872
my father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	117.48318030658103
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	759.3431818625368
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	305.09190387437553
but you are always giving her the preference."	204.04831919992674
lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	489.84402598431956
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	1342.362517337307
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley!	422.86239518513116
but on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.	125.4303408824116
the gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	164.30086697920183
"is my father in town?"	251.84233728311779
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	211.47245809349474
his own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	364.0584161936469
on entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	214.147183760727
said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	130.1243125233164
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	1850.236430450309
"oh!	271.02234991487614
in the former were many good paintings; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	617.5587540056756
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy."	370.800137696526
the subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	226.46312184432796
the first week of their return was soon gone.	504.30887793243573
chapter xxiii.	20779.900857932542
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week.	190.26100807280696
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	327.69084772922594
they have at least that advantage."	299.1230872836576
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	102.92448978938012
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	198.1875811881233
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?"	291.42899428469747
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	162.24108755479563
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy!	93.19115055681773
their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	1562.779378355873
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	129.081664569566
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself.	312.530552797156
mrs collins knew not what to make of him.	171.15568591999573
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	184.8204018419559
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	106.59444607924088
but to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character!	555.8253709178521
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	223.60913965224157
"oh!	271.02234991487614
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	150.6857422015565
he had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us.	128.4324446614023
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."	199.56407219959675
if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	104.86451426669854
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	1566.2655052426283
when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	262.42735179200804
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	128.90347431266147
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	538.3133772234435
"most willingly."	1083.7645188849212
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield.	228.7300561494017
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	239.87515070687354
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	37.54847694335735
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	309.1150913646919
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable.	108.09730915503457
london: printed for t.	97.5360461963182
and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	328.1147123472603
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with mr gardiner.	311.6070303954001
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	212.3865717058839
you will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	166.728157240571
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	74.64351237117506
she wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	247.89488508122264
to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	1102.5164288232795
i must have employment and society.	688.3178672781344
if, indeed, it should be so!	127.42444119280596
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	455.42475656440473
you know i have.	271.4009607806121
they were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	260.02897871045843
chapter v.	440.93963481431535
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	215.53390265265145
she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.	126.62835528015214
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	145.48341441791527
i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	237.60763724993237
i never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	258.4464362755017
thank heaven!	464.03223253152356
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	191.382629567701
that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	176.1957104975247
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to table.	48.164572586897734
chapter xvii.	440.93963481431535
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."	166.07314286861558
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	180.27080699864845
she began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	587.3401502656102
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there."	166.8992275513276
"take whatever you like, and get away."	228.37993536145243
their powers of conversation were considerable.	1524.4495831643196
she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows."	279.21090102700236
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile.	387.9501618201479
my visit was not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out.	319.2476487645936
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	792.0472941569824
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you."	238.9073237742147
"i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man."	376.5229741513209
his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	753.0142238119605

my friend has an excellent understanding--though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	219.08577779344157
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	136.6554612651655
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	330.9624620249681
london: printed for t.	97.5360461963182
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	132.3703193615915
she has known him only a fortnight.	339.7433945643524
why did she come?	749.7977789181671
i am going away myself."	184.7313675306393
what is it you are talking of?	209.4477650674936
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	119.79820306669495
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	318.4395144022047
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	74.66480625718411
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	588.8529039835944
is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	852.7163420447276
if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.	2328.343618897983
but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	133.43363621859882
he had never had the slightest suspicion.	480.10631041446015
their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	224.4180731572455
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	84.6423782407935
she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	445.2406541467131
but i am at his disposal.	144.217535385326
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.	615.2017387002359
"and what did she say?"	214.274286651676
little more than half a day's journey.	139.01208604126555
you refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	1088.1979869689378
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	334.4808286992166
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	441.1465644001337
he scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	255.93784756285376
his choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	330.56506655708296
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	1111.2682723462867
he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	230.76392592780203
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	396.51309344574724
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the trouble of practising.	333.847554847341
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	85.70527459276374
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	404.00919420341035
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you will drink to our good journey.	219.72075684956505
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	285.8754393805394
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!	191.38182276220215
she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	221.12053675391033
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	1136.5403959341966
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.	843.6019011258929
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield.	173.1593291912218
i only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it.	531.0760619820913
for my part, mr bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently.	344.14884660640115
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.	317.4171342028013
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	476.73407258905314
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved in civility."	649.7874732766383
they followed her into the dining-parlour.	419.58260359133277
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	40281.43248962554
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy returned within the stated time.	409.2951624931928
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.	504.73398723111563
i had not believed it possible."	200.8302356372862
the carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	161.20288955393715
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	102.62766855043857
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	918.2062921633511
"oh!	271.02234991487614
it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been.	454.20179341741186
his character is thereby complete."	1107.4701455102618
"no, not at all."	90.44169176701175
"what will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are!	140.09095395782592
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	680.0858588504105
"fitzwilliam darcy."	358.1745589559705
said he, smiling.	288.9846044644988
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to rosings.	106.03963286790948
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement.	327.57040827756055
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	396.15568554764644
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer."	106.34785632935487
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.	206.93461845441786
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	358.28837119192934
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"	96.36589057493843
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."	119.25684970458208
"to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."	228.63190540179673
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	70.09780035511822
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	219.84517045689313
"oh!	271.02234991487614
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you will wait on him of course."	52.933062011823516
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	2096.2934772482413
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	150.01554161031322
chapter ix.	440.93963481431535
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	453.43766095586517
but in matters of greater weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	365.33535684560263
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	389.8871765000904
"i desire you will do no such thing.	105.01354825321852
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	204.28747861824584
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	595.0148912347449
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	425.83605921473657
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	584.8392509790293
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."	327.52472540443284
heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?	1064.1197043192758
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	329.33789654728537
the next was in these words.	211.98538604094227
"are you, indeed?	279.92882745928415
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	2090.9936881791687
mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	186.46667937203185
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	404.96096076112786
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	151.4318421699824
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	921.5378366025546
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	181.2507739204248
she wrote even to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	231.7719383708509
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	266.37235105947394
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire.	226.08825249478775
it cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened.	214.85822813769119
an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	407.9402212278464
you need not.	304.8176672535242
the adieu is charity itself.	9101.237558436369
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	516.8204520007897
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	75.24137526046498
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--she could have added, "a young man too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner!"	174.76679638661057
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	309.13704146736916
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	367.5506975372
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	283.52576178614714
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	125.7378034819629
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	177.87695834092756
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	70.39468046768417
1.e.8.	64.45994739749796
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	65.6800989331178
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy.	180.89280744177594
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses.	23003.755893726622
but is it certain, absolutely certain?"	360.87130627890673
if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	252.9589259012387
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	473.480102531668
take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	165.39582713903857
well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	172.66065986834016
accompanied by a violent yawn.	4372.318476942407
"there is nothing the matter with me.	107.45085260640727
"you need not distress yourself.	450.16432698811747
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.	224.88274820343753
you cannot have been always at longbourn."	130.35275651666635
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	580.6425101400006
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	169.34118578863533
and when you have given your ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	147.6789308981255
but against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	506.34237613544497
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."	176.96899368574697
mr darcy!	354.19042205508305
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard, and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	874.9760424149948
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	250.99338949923597
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	226.6833776065001
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas.	180.484971358985
but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	309.02630233158055
as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	494.95878316708144
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	3650.7927679585828
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	346.7407487653755
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	328.26935788945565
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"	746.4825491705448
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	407.6709111877647
chapter xix.	440.93963481431535
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	105.26729524771324
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	724.179697324255
i expected you to stay two months.	280.64654020603655
he found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	243.63375459086024
but whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	269.74965099940226
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.	2809.954736307745
she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	1184.7801475451597
"hate you!	1416.3522411547356
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford.	577.5616353232039
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins.	84.46644303567633
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him.	594.724033849185
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	357.417109466832
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	281.41721517374094
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	88.7711939154877
the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them.	248.03405951916022
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old."	146.97653455693154
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller."	629.6560001100976
they met again on sunday, and then i saw him too.	197.25304513807504
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	152.65363872779187
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	852.7067329286688
why any fear of detection?	1702.699838585061
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	816.0475991607908
he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	365.7119520300768
she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	376.2137704218442
"you were mr bingley's first choice."	156.12881623058783
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	361.35799633003677
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	583.0502820041755
chapter xvi.	440.93963481431535
you shall not defend her, though it is charlotte lucas.	222.9252183483553
but no such recollection befriended her.	3113.8610774036442
i have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	86.72629804577105
she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr darcy, she was directly retreating.	256.5958127655749
you both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	358.9162014608613
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	1234.824667098611
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	576.1426078581384
she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	202.60887375575015
my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for.	82.05568848213048
i have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	326.3162595466262
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	280.0170294744053
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	250.55412336950948
by many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	332.7708417672388
my dear, dear jane, i am so happy!	69.46932446631826
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	917.6881279641981
elizabeth smiled.	726.7475027799137
"yes, ma'am, all."	58.44690643814695
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "i can hardly be just to him."	70.24740659277279
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	301.87835195630214
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins, and i will never see you again if you do."	81.02504871930977
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	576.2844021230525
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	232.52701152599656
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	168.63295108776245
we must not all expect jane's good fortune."	160.7072508918563
since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	170.85352751137603
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers."	245.4973748043983
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to understand it.	80.47657224334259
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	517.283115047437
it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	124.49857044259271
"i am all astonishment.	241.60505183872374
mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	272.03107311752575
how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!	642.5474700829127
"so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find.	92.39966199328096
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	596.7443582769253
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	261.72242594372204
"to-morrow fortnight."	731.3707422876988
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	601.950699818672
jane shook her head.	307.395300723591
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	2038.4989223970965
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	109.46902821954649
till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	87.48285600574118
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following, as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	336.0127966858547
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte.	558.3260767601271
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	511.53830529242003
"oh!"	168.74486172860762
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	4751.71876613666
and who knows what may happen?	1337.007006614635
he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."	233.9621733834433
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."	174.42177965127433
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i could."	274.6571834255326
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	151.36947741432132
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	2448.0661568088535
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all."	279.349451966958
"does that young lady know mr darcy?"	221.34634824447286
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh.	344.48573640065246
the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	417.6841632080074
such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	296.896622137036
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	470.98462410227705
* * * * * mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	112.10317661424658
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	133.68847626976526
oh, lydia!"	344.2934102164328
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.	2085.460785520658
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	192.72864656241336
nothing could be more delightful!	616.6639675150278
"i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	127.72328971042275
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	211.51297930343264
all was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	250.40422162176662
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	497.84983680669177
"i am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before?	91.66123844889965
they are gone off together from brighton.	357.23829569346896
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	3337.8053473560303
"yet why did he come?"	414.01471952105607
"you forget that i have made no answer.	144.92054486422185
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	519.3337543317649
he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	1883.7558411004316
he did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september, than any body else in the country.	305.74874430781944
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	155.08687358144476
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."	141.06890038842025
i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.	90.06027116115428
his principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	576.8955633181708
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court."	401.09827238579595
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	328.94752040119084
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	67.24799093110668
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak what i think."	254.88538386819008
i am very, very sorry.	139.9774229746604
he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention."	119.08840063358217
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	223.86658747850908
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	288.5340643980781
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	258.9262104267747
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	531.8114743886241
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."	399.50980513884804
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	615.5678326740864
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?	56.308624542532485
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr collins too!--why should he have it more than anybody else?"	174.21427788305564
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	292.8035375023554
"mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	236.728846799259
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	132.93387857196427
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	582.5263368721934
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at st james's.	163.0298927701507
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	213.807622642189
the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would i give to hear your strictures on them!"	1346.2988054300065
and when i returned home, the ----shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	168.52241803193436
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	337.9534354460577
my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal."	98.72861901076593
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends.	253.39742422351551
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."	277.9141313153681
you have done all this!	221.2473998135235
teazing, teazing, man!	1704.7754118161631
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	107.49474543207145
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	213.8446047156243
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	183.87343695896706
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	405.35257748219135
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	160.55871580571701
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful.	250.73768034513
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	265.73904069444916
"you are uniformly charming!"	549.0587449697009
younger sons cannot marry where they like."	2453.3029492228166
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	144.49403389811823
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	1400.8450942555128
it is really too distressing.	383.33062161305213
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	330.91228849912875
pride & prejudice.	233.81636147877583
your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."	1968.9260024741227
one must speak a little, you know.	222.23917441430086
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	171.7201585195306
then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----" "if he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much!	276.11064152681934
"oh!	271.02234991487614
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	320.4166559144724
a lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	747.2661109845087
poor dear child!	2317.825499419719
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	151.52649842583213
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	559.6206669800486
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	221.39224790422787
the girls stared at their father.	425.30084792135517
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued, "i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, 'she a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."	216.2290659013796
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	426.4759717680549
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	108.6063849197935
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	340.25394694182785
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	119.48959231222537
at such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."	677.4043710988491
'tis as good as a lord!	473.8875362022156
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."	114.44290387191597
here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	1127.7855577779653
my feelings in every respect forbid it.	270.4425611985236
but so they always are.	695.4822470915972
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	427.56409715138483
mr darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	123.67897662512829
were questions with which she amused herself.	1087.7658634475595
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	229.61851040699625
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.	870.87709988468
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	193.0251741532251
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	1484.3867626525084
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	476.19962608479364
"if he does not come to me, then," said she, "i shall give him up for ever."	39.32750731509996
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	76.84659242645967
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	284.76893705686365
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	181.1896855224067
he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	479.9923782979504
how could i be so silly as to wish it!	241.68784878435983
"then, who taught you?	609.8442001356432
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	119.29992782343103
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	595.5959163431587
do not distress me by the idea.	389.48785959323754
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."	336.88033770712514
jane looked at her doubtingly.	1636.2042725225042
if you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.	600.8861383413794
"mr collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	428.0295407021423
"some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me.	93.69774594911725
"'tis too much!"	253.74912413336935
where, where is my uncle?"	244.6659259363063
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	245.80994998548383
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	58.296590529255724
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"	101.11828995064619
to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.	122.67179276381397
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	286.1266137207494
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	670.4537938994515
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	303.9462922002287
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	887.9279101879149
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	448.0108099594984
in three volumes.	232.8437795838202
his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	168.44939574171403
"la!	521.6693691156485
but are you pleased, jane?	322.2049750608323
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	322.66328816236063
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"	115.48238952350688
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	353.69747717894245
from what can it proceed?	1074.849002230942
it would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	390.14651503929315
mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	233.72369245556456
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him."	94.76951528841612
what made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	505.17714078638517
"well, well, and so mr bingley is coming down, sister," (for mrs philips first brought her the news.) "well, so much the better.	129.04259229436695
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	321.4612564596872
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia once.	162.96674474077028
"i never saw such a woman.	92.39662307135305
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	114.20794806901729
i thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	85.5245887071146
"has your governess left you?"	782.5246625511822
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	117.93732529213672
it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	197.43185737830362
"heaven forbid!--that would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me such an evil."	121.36177767031955
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	143.32817294929225
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he did--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr robinson."	108.5546692753035
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort.	262.5393943307032
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	44.878598504617564
"can i have the carriage?"	191.95408452451824
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	146.1959939403699
our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."	252.02740360892278
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	168.43552434793506
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	357.45309405650534
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	704.4567480574875
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	128.2943511905906
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.	622.6068018356946
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	287.94174790164243
you never see a fault in any body.	448.8931393550826
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet came from it.	71.18156575029221
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	824.7303172085458
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.	386.65905215415046
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	181.94074224366713
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	625.4512313216177
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	578.7466641646841
my uncle!"	383.9658985220694
"you are then resolved to have him?"	209.4188552699546
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"	270.25354055218094
but, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	178.36866001067543
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	614.5537242808654
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	126.63414341915039
by you, i was properly humbled.	653.3378333080468
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum."	926.7390810841478
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	1646.557505697315
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself.	255.18694182680974
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!	273.0981175426098
there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	169.56521422565018
but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	284.2837651648386
they have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	487.9993331684095
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	390.8936901432414
chapter ii.	494.93800552600936
1.f.1.	77.29786367167914
he still loves me, and we are engaged."	596.2097148761653
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.	73.38904740324386
you are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	124.59658670284674
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	358.99121932942904
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	164.84580399873687
within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	326.04800817304584
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!	314.6313921754195
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	299.4684526509387
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think."	78.5171416432313
on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	586.4944050238388
i speak feelingly.	8009.630364243994
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.	176.4271720948067
and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.	101.28426715208552
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy.	92.01144220341345
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	320.07818908870075
the loo table, however, did not appear.	290.2948022663271
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, i am sure.	189.78363416613823
i will not tell you what it is.	120.89281090923909
she is all affability and condescension, and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	165.82842110745952
chapter xiv.	440.93963481431535
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	176.37948574227312
elizabeth was distressed.	399.30579719438765
mrs gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	194.59026692690017
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject."	89.8809070010927
"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley, and under your orders."	117.70070042373904
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her, saying, "i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	103.38396407447962
in short, i will do my best."	216.59934791028496
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."	78.5925928009248
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	736.6791650524613
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	137.59942299910188
my youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	282.23735798579645
"you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	181.39738339060233
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"	119.18794990581998
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."	141.73233122291848
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	248.02920466577515
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	111.98482986552695
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	176.48826243584358
if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!	496.2712847494688
"not as you represent it.	654.330240566521
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.	1250.9564531611973
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	511.6213022913469
"his misfortunes!"	510.2834615708949
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	143.981795703971
i do not know who is good enough for him."	74.29189502969696
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	216.8213213595388
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	175.26572269237718
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	405.8247192032942
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away.	188.59988449607155
how strange must it appear to him!	741.3544627533049
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	721.1271515538548
there's for you!	316.7137449013989
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	329.1522520073341
but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1879.1793156727185
give me farther particulars.	923.3677739407121
what is your own opinion?"	260.40604958023516
a little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	93.46165837490392
but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	135.7648682504826
the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	471.07493004104754
i am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	378.10889067900973
he has given in all his debts; i hope at least he has not deceived us.	173.74740037530228
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	69.22247303432664
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	788.2146590566465
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	145.57278358686642
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	467.414380682827
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.	129.6500818268073
if this be the case, he deserves you.	246.380169726557
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family.	117.61244448515696
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	249.90912955204695
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	168.74289127928134
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	800.4523052347108
my dear lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	171.9432288666374
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	6094.161157061802
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.	178.46990443448612
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	1077.8263480331404
"i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.	297.9390127827785
its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	2510.91282993406
she was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."	422.0634191808767
"a place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	301.7823417694244
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	270.15448911983793
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy.	133.99371219620156
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	244.65168617262208
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	344.36666531069227
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	47.671049610927724
but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	266.8606573427912
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	304.9970925685907
cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner.	201.0534636144483
"not so hasty, if you please.	222.03166350879974
"your examination of mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	92.81822315266758
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	160.7598376049352
i am most seriously displeased."	828.4553261484127
she comes to us to-day.	679.5962118073514
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	869.123288394132
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	1044.2824497472118
"i am sure i know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	214.60809615300494
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling.	375.172454990786
he begged pardon for having displeased her.	1726.0901338736626
but they did pass away, and mr and mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn.	164.24527188134448
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	168.20729281749382
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton.	235.47733681074067
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	659.666154681894
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	822.9773217101105
i wish i could see her.	113.68683886374207
"what think you of books?"	197.485979837772
i pity, though i cannot help blaming her.	394.71849521511615
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	167.4358813253624
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	339.24829876869467
so genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every body.--that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."	337.0272739997193
was not a man to be trusted.	128.4683481659813
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	243.92294158803375
"i honour your circumspection.	1402.6082851644585
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	92.00075649040022
but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is.	168.3973701614072
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	154.454777209992
"true.	508.128958974563
let wickham be your man.	1131.94541048788
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	355.346224326893
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	105.07476686424022
she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	3918.8554664225635
"ah!	411.51459383306917
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	175.18965053738825
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	350.24247906335756
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	189.2351314934124
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind.	712.8854069674697
mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	483.95348385795785
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."	588.866030590929
mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before."	245.6919983556684
he has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one.	613.0706316126287
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	244.77752365635416
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."	241.8424890530182
well, he is a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	120.24386405763033
it is nearly fifty miles."	581.1171353713889
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."	84.5386858259483
during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	196.74348610078383
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, i assure you.	174.45214722526458
my mind was more agreeably engaged.	1088.859224582691
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."	458.907616715057
"you quite mistook mr darcy.	1578.4648411581913
"how near it may be to mine, i cannot pretend to say.--you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	253.2847276814979
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	343.5433759200489
"if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside," cried bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."	513.6371386360903
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."	99.24692376141597
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c.	1573.8013594500326
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.	211.22218671268868
"oh!	271.02234991487614
then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	1378.7982166659772
sir william had been delighted with him.	215.28272267930106
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	739.559749569515
